We had two things we wanted to sneak peek but we couldn't decide, so why not do both 😛 20 October Sneak peek for Llyn-by-the-Sea's entrance was released. Sneak peeked Llyn-by-the-Sea 17 December - Version 1.4 Llyn-by-the-Sea added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a major terminus with 7 platforms, serving Stepford Connect and Stepford Express . Introduced a new kind of junction, "Alternating Points", to diverge and spread out trains to reduce load. Llyn-by-the-Sea is now shown in the intro . New routes: R024 , R026 , R077 & R078 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 New routes: R036 & R037 29 October - Version 1.7 Added Stepford Express services to Stepford Central via Morganstown . New routes: R080 & R081 2021 21 January Sneak peek for Llyn-by-the-Sea's overhaul was released. Did someone say another refurbishment?! 🌃 Coming soon 19 February - Version 1.7.2 Station overhauled, added a Signaller Training Academy room and Staff Mess Room . Platforms increased from 7 to 12; lines entering the station increased from 4 to 6. The Starryloch Signal Box was replaced by the Llyn-by-the-Sea Rail Operations Centre , located in the station, to control Signal Zone E. New route: R040 Bug : Signals are bugged under manual control. This was later fixed in an unknown date. 5 December - Version 1.8 Platform allocation is now randomised. Added Stepford Connect services to Leighton West . Route change: R037 ( Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City <> Llyn-by-the-Sea ) Now terminates at Leighton City. New route: R042 18 December - Version 1.8.1 Bug : Buffers do not despawn trains. 19 December Bugfix : Buffers now despawn trains properly. 15 May - Version 1.9 Added Stepford Express services to the Newry branch . New routes: R083 , R084 & R085 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Stepford Express platforms (P0-6) extended to accomodate for longer trains. The Signaller Training Academy room was changed to include Trainee Signaller desks. Additional props such as bins added to the platforms. Added Stepford Connect & Stepford Express services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New routes: R050 & R087 24 December - Version 2.1 New route: R088 Trivia [ ] Prior to V1.7.2, the inspiration of this station was debatable. Some in the community say it was based on London King's Cross while some smaller arguments include Liverpool Lime Street , London Liverpool Street and other stations. However, the V1.7.2 version of Llyn-by-the-Sea is heavily based on London King's Cross , evident from the entrance, concourse roofs and the platforms. This station was the 5th station to be revealed on the Llyn extension, revealed on 18 October 2019. This station is the southern end of the Stepford Main Line , with the northern end located at Stepford Central . From this station to Starryloch , it is roughly parallel to the Stepford Central - Morganstown - Leighton Stepford Road line. This station has the third highest number of platforms out of all stations on the SCR network , with 12, after Benton (13) and Stepford Central (16). This station was the first in V1.4 to feature a new kind of junction called "Alternating Points", which "switch from straight to diverging with each train to help ease the load and spread out the arrivals at Llyn-by-the-Sea", with more stations planned to incorporate the feature. Then V1.8 saw the widespread introduction of randomised platform allocation, similar to this. However since then, this has been replaced by randomised allocation as trains no longer diverge to the other track. This station is one of nine stations managed by National Rail , the others being Stepford Victoria , Stepford Central , Stepford East , St Helens Bridge , Benton , Morganstown , Leighton City , and Stepford Airport Central . This station is based off a Welsh station name. If the name "Llyn" is translated to English, it means "Lake". This was the second station in SCR to have a terminating platform serving more than one operator, until in V1.7.2 it was changed so that Stepford Connect and Stepford Express use separate platforms. Players can walk to the beach from this station. The station's signage before V1.6 (and the large sign outside the station before V1.7.2) said 'Llyn-by-the-sea', using a lowercase ' s '. However, the maps and destination boards display Llyn-by-the-Sea, using an uppercase '''S'''. The speed limit entering into and leaving from this station used to be 15 MPH, among the lowest speed limit in the entire game. However in V1.7.2, the tunnels and tunnel layout changed as a whole, and the speed limits are now 45 MPH throughout the tunnels and into the station itself. In V2.0 , the 15 MPH returned with the introduction of a 15 MPH speed limit at most terminating platforms across the network. If the player's render distance is high enough, they can barely see the Stepford City Zone over the sea. Before V1.4 (and before The Big Update ), this station could be accessed, and per announcements, was just " Llyn ". This station is the farthest station from Stepford Central via rail. A full Stepford Connect service from Stepford Central to Llyn-by-the-Sea would take 45 minutes, which can be done as R024 or for Stepford Express that can take as long as 23 minutes or short as 17 minutes as R077 and R078 respectively, and variations via Morganstown instead of Benton , such as R080 and R081 . This station is considered as a major terminus and has ticket barriers and machines, seats, lounges and some offices. This station is popular for 'flooding' (purposefully making the station/line very busy) as it is considered to be typically quiet. This station is the fourth station to have a Rail Operations Centre, Llyn-by-the-Sea Rail Operations Centre , after Stepford Central , Stepford East (removed in V1.4.1 ) and Benton . The Zone E ( Edgemead to Llyn) signalling desk was moved here from Starryloch as of V1.7.2. As of V1.7.2, the Stepford Express Headquarters is located here. As of V1.7.2, a new Signaller Training Academy room has also been added. It is speculated that it will play a role in Signaller Training 2.0 in the future. There are two offices for Supervisors and Managers here. They are located next to the Signaller Training Academy and Staff Mess Room respectively. However, both offices have no specific room for each department, unlike the offices at Stepford Central . A Staff Mess Room has also been added in V1.7.2. Only players ranked Dispatcher and above are able to enter. There is a siding just outside Platform 0 at this station, where a Class 68 locomotive is parked. No trains can spawn there though, and players have to spawn at Northshore Depot instead. This is one of three stations in SCR to have a Platform 0, the others being Stepford Central and Stepford Airport Central . The layout of this station is based on the King's Cross (pre-uncrossed layout), demonstrated by the flyover as well as the change of the lines from a DS, DF, UF, US configuration to a DS, US, DF, UF configuration. With the new track layout, there are more platforms for Stepford Express (7) than Stepford Connect (5). Before V1.7.2, destination displays on the trains and Passenger Information Screens displayed the station as 'Llyn-by-the-Sea', with hyphens. As of V1.7.2, the hyphens have been removed, now displayed as 'Llyn by the Sea' instead. As of V2.0 , this is one of the five to have a lounge , being the second after Stepford Central . Others can be found at Stepford Airport Central , Westwyvern and Northshore . If a player is a Guard and go to main menu on duty and then selects a train stopped on one of showcased platforms, a message box appears with the text "Must be spawned to request guard". Many players have been asking for AirLink to stop at Llyn-by-the-Sea. Various staff members have stated this will not happen and that the station will only be served by Stepford Connect and Stepford Express , as this would just make Stepford Express obsolete. In response to this, on 1st April 2025, however, AirLink had their services extended to Llyn-by-the-Sea for April Fools' Day only. Routes that terminate at this station sometimes have poor timetables, especially when coming from Northshore Depot , causing on-time Drivers to have to wait multiple minutes at the terminating platform before being able to turn around or despawn. Passengers can take a direct Stepford Express train from here to 15 of its 16 stations (all except Eden Quay ). It is tied with Benton , Leighton City & Leighton Stepford Road in this matter.

History [ ] 2019 17 December - Version 1.4 Millcastle added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms used by Stepford Connect and an island platform for Stepford Express . Stepford Express passes and does not stop here however. New routes: R024 , R025 & R026 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch .

New route: R042 2024 22 April Sneak peek for Millcastle's overhaul was released. Lets hope the signals don't reflect off that windscreen too much... 12 August - Version 2.0 Station overhauled, concourse is no longer located above the platforms. Now located near Platform 1, connected to all platforms using a footbridge. Platform layout is unchanged and Stepford Express still does not serve the station. Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New routes: R050 & R102 Trivia [ ] This station has step-free access. Platforms 2 and 3 are unused for unknown reasons. They are the passing platforms for Stepford Express , making this station part of a 5-way tie between this station, Whitney Green , Greenslade , Hampton Hargate and Millcastle Racecourse for the most unused platforms of any station. In the sneak peek of the upgraded Millcastle, there are benches on Platform 2 and 3. Some players speculated that the platforms may be used for services in V2.0 . However, this was not materialised, as they remain unused after the update. This station, along with Westwyvern , were the only two stations on the Llyn extension that were not revealed in any way on the SCR Official Discord server before opening. This station is next to multiple playing fields, which might mean that Millcastle is known for sports. It is possible to walk from this station to Millcastle Racecourse without trespassing . Despite the fact that Platforms 2 and 3 are unused, warning announcements still sound for Stepford Express trains passing those platforms. The same applies to Platforms 2 and 3 at Millcastle Racecourse . The distance between this station and Westwyvern is the longest distance between any two stations without any stations in between, measuring at 2.16 miles. The distance between Hampton Hargate and Water Newton was once the longest until Upper Staploe was added in between the two stations in V1.7 . Oddly, in the previous version of the station, one of the lights between the platforms under the concourse had 3 missing parts. Looking closely, where the old station used to be located can be seen, as the fountain and shops in that area remained the same. The light on the left is normal, while the one on the right has most of its parts missing Gallery [ ] Version 1.4 - V1.10.13 [ ] Entrance Interior Platform View 1 Platform View 2 Platform View 3 Unused Platforms View Stations Willowfield • Hemdon Park • Beechley • Stepford Victoria • Financial Quarter • City Hospital • Stepford Central • Stepford East • Stepford High Street • Whitefield Lido • Stepford United Football Club • Woodhead Lane • Houghton Rake • Whitefield • St Helens Bridge • New Harrow • Elsemere Pond • Elsemere Junction • Berrily • East Berrily • Beaulieu Park • Morganstown • Angel Pass • Bodin • Coxly • Benton • Port Benton • Benton Bridge • Stepford Airport Parkway • Stepford Airport Central • Airport Terminal 2 • Hampton Hargate • Upper Staploe • Water Newton • Winstree • Rocket Parade • Leighton Stepford Road • Leighton City • Leighton West • Rayleigh Bay • Carnalea Bridge • Aslockby • Edgemead • Faymere • Westercoast • Millcastle Racecourse • Millcastle • Westwyvern • Starryloch • Northshore • Llyn-by-the-Sea List of Stations • List of Stations (Statistics) • List of Station Codes Upcoming stations are marked in italics , former stations are marked in strikethrough .

History [ ] 2019 26 November Sneak peek for Millcastle Racecourse was released, in a signalling board. Christmas lights 🎄 17 December - Version 1.4 Millcastle Racecourse added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a limited-service Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms used by Stepford Connect and an island platform for Stepford Express . Stepford Express passes and does not stop here however. New route: R025 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 New route: R038 29 October - Version 1.7 Added Stepford Connect services to Llyn-by-the-Sea . New route: R040 2021 19 November Sneak peek for Millcastle Racecourse's overhaul was released. Another little station upgrade that we thought we would do ready for v1.8... Probably not as difficult to work out which one this is 😉 Coming soon in v1.8 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled, new platforms, footbridge and station entrance, with lifts installed. The station is now step-free. Platforms are now 2 island platforms shared by Stepford Connect and Stepford Express . Route change: R038 ( Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City <> Westwyvern ) Now terminates at Leighton City. 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 2 & 3. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New routes: R050 & R102 Trivia [ ] This station was first shown in a signalling board sneak peek on 28 November 2019. This is the second station to be near a stadium, with the first one being Stepford United Football Club . As of the V1.4 update, Platforms 2 and 3 are unused for unknown reason. They are the Stepford Express passing platforms, making this station part of a 5-way tie between Whitney Green , Greenslade , Hampton Hargate , this station, and Millcastle for the most unused platforms of any station at two. Of the eleven Stepford Connect routes that run through this station, only five of them ( R025 , R038 , R040 , R050 and R102 ) call here, making this station a limited-service station. Since V2.0 , players can walk from this station to Millcastle via road. Although Platforms 2 and 3 remain unused, the non-stop platform warning announcements for Stepford Express trains passing through the station are still sounded. The same applies to Platforms 2 and 3 at Millcastle . Stepford Express might have been intended to stop here, as this station has on-board announcements for the operator here. However, no announcements have been found for Stepford Express at Millcastle . The IET stop markers being added to the station in V1.10.8 further supports this, potentially meaning that Stepford Express might stop here in the future. However, this is not confirmed . Although being a non-dispatchable station, there are OFF indicators at this station for guards . Starryloch also shares this trait. The farthest station a passenger can get from this station on one train before requiring to change to another is St Helens Bridge . This station is the only station on the Stepford Main Line and one of the five Stepford Connect stations which do not have a route calling at Stepford Central , the others are Leighton West , Aslockby , Carnalea Bridge , and Rayleigh Bay . Upper Staploe used to have this trait as well until V1.8 , when R003 ( Stepford Central <> Leighton City ) started calling there. This station's name is the longest out of any other two-word-long station on the entire network, being twenty letters long. This station was made by Developer Thehazad9. There is a parked Class 68 at the station's siding. There is a part from an old light model on the approach path to the station underneath an existing light. The station is adjacent to the horse racecourse of the same name. This station has the biggest sign located on the Llyn side end of the platforms.

History [ ] 2018 9 December Sneak peek for Morganstown was released, as part of Day 9 of the Advent Calendar. It's Day 9 and today we present another new station: Morganstown. Close to Morganstown Docks (Waterline), this station serves multiple lines including Connect and is along the same extension branch as Berrily (yesterday's sneak peek). All coming to the game in V1.1 🎀 31 December - Version 1.1 Morganstown added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a major through station and terminus with 6 platforms, serving Stepford Connect and AirLink .

SAC → MGT P6, then P4 Bug : The signal at Platform 5B (W118) displays and stays stuck on Danger, even with no traffic. This is only visual. This was fixed later in an unknown date. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Platform allocation is now randomised at P1-2, 4 & 6. Bug : Trains cannot close doors at Platform 5A & B, unless there is a Guard . 18 December - Version 1.8.1 Bugfix : Trains now can close doors normally at Platform 5A & B. 2022 15 May - Version 1.9 Added Stepford Express services to Newry and Benton .

Added Waterline services to Newry Harbour . New route: R120 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Added Metro services. New routes: R130 , R131 & R137 5 August - Version 2.2.1 A poster named "Network Expansion" was added next to the station entrance. This won the first Community Spotlight hosted in May 2025. 'Network Expansion' by exexexe5 22 October Sneak peek for Morganstown's upgrade was released, based on Stalybridge station . It's all change at this station and beyond. 🌆 🚄 Coming to SCR version 2.3 Trivia [ ] Morganstown is the first, and currently the only, station to serve all five operators as of Version 2.2 . Before Metro , Morganstown was also the only station to serve all the other four operators since Version 1.7 . Despite this, Morganstown is often unused, as many AirLink and Stepford Express services skip this station and not many Stepford Connect , Metro and Waterline services terminate here, compared to Benton . This is one of two stations to have letter subdivided platforms (the other being Esterfield ). During parts of late 2019, the platform announcements were glitched when the station name was said. They were fixed in the Five Million Update . This also occurred at New Harrow and Berrily . Despite being a large station, there were no CIS Boards before V1.4.1 . The same was said for Berrily , but these were added in an earlier update. This station is the first Waterline - AirLink interchange, the second being Airport Terminal 2 . Morganstown Siding is located east of Morganstown, which leads to Platform 6. This siding can only used by R015 , R120 and R137 . AirLink trains can not spawn there, however. Due to the short length of the siding, which cannot fit most AirLink trains . The nearby Stepford Airport Parkway TMD is used instead. This station, as well as Westercoast and Willowfield , have the longest single-word station names, with the overall longest station name being Stepford United Football Club . Before the Morganstown Shuttle was opened in V1.6 , there were no direct rail connections between this station and Morganstown Docks . At that time, if a passenger wanted to go to Morganstown Docks from here, they needed to take a Stepford Connect service to Beaulieu Park , then walk to Whitney Green and take a Waterline train to Morganstown Docks . On 5 September 2020, Former Managing Director Charlie_RBX posted a preview of the upgraded Morganstown "courtesy of Thehazad9", but at the time the station was unknown. It was confirmed in the SCR Discord Signalling Lounge by former Operations Manager RLSJ1997 that it was Morganstown later that month. Although players can see Hampton Hargate from here with a high enough render distance, there is no direct link, so passengers have to travel via Leighton Stepford Road or Benton . Despite Morganstown being a major interchange station, it does not have ticket gates or card readers. On the Stepford Connect map, the Morganstown Connect routes shows its availability to go from Morganstown to Beechley. As of Version 2.2 , no Stepford Connect route exists that goes from Morganstown to Beechley nor from Berrily either. R034 (now used for Metro ) used to originally be a Stepford Connect route, which follows the Morganstown Connect route lines. Same goes for R030 . The 13 October 2025 sneak peek shows a double Class 350 /1 headed to Westwyvern via Elsemere Junction . This has led to speculation about an upgrade to the station connecting the Stepford Connect tracks to the Stepford Main Line . The overhauled Morganstown station which will be released in Version 2.3 is being criticised by the community mainly because of the removal of the canopy. Hence, players may call it a ‘downgrade’ instead of an overhaul. Previous speculations & plans [ ] An intended operator called 'High Speed' that was planned to pass through Morganstown. But it was integrated with Stepford Express when services commenced to Morganstown in Version 1.7 . There used to be a part of the station called Morganstown High Level , which was just 2 elevated platforms. They had no connection to Morganstown station, but had a link to Morganstown Docks . Eventually, it was replaced by Platforms 5A and 5B, with the original platforms being demolished. It is possible that the Morganstown Shuttle was planned to terminate at Morganstown High Level. Prior to V1.7 , the rails at Platforms 1 and 2 extended noticeably beyond the buffers. Many players had speculated that there would be an extension for Stepford Connect on the Morganstown Branch, though this never happened. The sneak peek of the new driving HUD for V2.0 showed a Stepford Express service allocated to Platform 5 at Morganstown, leading players to believe the update would include a revamp of the station. This was later confirmed to be a mistake by Community Director tjh44 .

History [ ] 2017 16 December Morganstown Docks added to the network, as a Waterline through station with 3 platforms. Being an infill station between Port Benton and Whitney Green . Platform 1 is unused. New route: R013 20 December New routes: R010 & Newry Harbour <> Greenslade 2018 21 April - Version 1.0 Route removal: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade Removed from the game. 2020 18 March - Version 1.4.4 Added Platform 4, it is unused and inaccessible, however. 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Waterline shuttle services to Morganstown via the Morganstown Flyover . Platform 1 & 4 are now in service. New route: R015 29 October - Version 1.7 Scenery near Morganstown Docks was upgraded, with an actual dock added next to the station. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled, platforms decreased from 4 to 2. Platforms are no longer specific to whether the train heads to/from Morganstown or Greenslade . Now an elevated station. Class 730/0 stop markers added. Announcement change: The Waterline announcement is now: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:MTDW.ogg instead of: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:MTDpre1.8.mp3 2022 15 May - Version 1.9 Stepford Express services can now pass this station. 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Platforms extended to fit the Class 195/1 . 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added Waterline services to Newry Harbour . New route: R120 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Added limited Metro services to Stepford Victoria and Morganstown . New route: R137 Trivia [ ] This station seems to be based off of the Dudley Port station in Tipton, Sandwell, West Midlands. This station has step-free access. With a gap of only 0.17 miles (274 metres), Morganstown Docks and Port Benton are the two closest stations on the whole network . Intially, the distance was a bit longer at 0.24 miles (386 metres). This beats Elsemere Pond and Elsemere Junction by 0.09 miles, which have a distance of 0.26 miles between the two stations. Because of the short distance between this station and Port Benton , there isn't enough time to play the "next station is" announcement between these stations. After closing the Waterline train doors on either this station or Port Benton , the train will immediately play "We will be shortly arriving at..." annoucement before the "Welcome on-board" announcement. It is possible to get off a train at this station, run to Port Benton , and catch the same train due to the short distance. Morganstown Docks is actually the newest station on the Greenslade Branch . Before it was added, trains just went between Port Benton to Whitney Green before Morganstown Docks was added between those two stations, making it an infill station. In Version 1.6 , the Morganstown Shuttle opened, and this station finally got a direct connection to Morganstown . Before that, if a player wanted to go from here to Morganstown , they would have to take a Waterline train to Whitney Green , then walk to Beaulieu Park , and then take a Stepford Connect service to Morganstown . Strangely, this station opened before the main Morganstown station. This station received a scenery update, with an actual dock next to the station in V1.7 . However, the station itself was not upgraded. Despite its name, this station is actually closer to Benton than it is to Morganstown , especially if the width of the River Ben is being taken into account. The platforms at this station are too short for the double Class 165 , 4-car Class 319 , 4-car Class 379 and 4-car Class 756 where the doors on the rear coach will not open. The announcement also plays on the Class 143 Double , despite all of the doors fitting on the platform. This is the only station that is managed by Waterline that Metro stops at. Despite the station lacking electrification, EMUs are still able to pass or serve the station. When driving a 3-car Class 195 , the driver will be prompted to move forward when the driver stopped at the S Car Marker perfectly.

History [ ] 2018 12 December Sneak peek for New Harrow was released, as part of Day 12 of the Advent Calendar. It's Day 12 and I accidentally took this picture during the night time but nevermind 😂 you can see how our new lighting looks at night too, so I suppose it's a double sneak peek. Here's New Harrow, another new station along the Connect extension! 👼 31 December - Version 1.1 New Harrow added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a limited-service Stepford Connect through station with 2 platforms. New route: R008 2019 20 January - Version 1.1.5 New Harrow is no longer dispatchable. 2020 15 April - Version 1.4.6 ( Ten Million Update ) New route: R027 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R030 29 October - Version 1.7 Scenery near New Harrow was upgraded, with a new Stepford Express flyover added over the station. New Harrow is now step-free. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 New route: R034 Route removal: R008 No longer stops here. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 New Harrow is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. New routes: R008 , R130 , R131 , R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 & R136 Trivia [ ] The announcements for this station, as well as Berrily and Morganstown , used to glitch and kill the station's announcements. This was fixed in V1.3.29. There was going to be an Old Harrow station which was going to serve Metro , however, it was demolished and the line going through that station was lifted. This station's platforms are slightly shorter than the length of a 5-car train. When a 5-car train approaches this station, the announcer will state that the doors of the rear coach will not open. This also happens at Hemdon Park , Woodhead Lane , Elsemere Pond and East Berrily . The scenery upgrade in V1.7 has made New Harrow to become somewhat iconic due to the flyover right before the station, and it is a great place for trainspotting. The station building itself was also slightly updated, with a ramp added at the entrance. Before that, this station was wheelchair accessible for interchange only as you must use the short staircase at the entrance to access the station. The announcements for Platform 1 are known to play too early before the train arrives. This is likely due to the placement of the sensor much further away from the station. The same occurs for Platform 1 at Upper Staploe . This is one of the only stations to have a foot crossing. Platform 2 is inaccessible to pedestrians and pedestrians cannot exit from platform 2 whilst there is a longer train at platform 2 or a train at platform 1 overshoots. Notes [ ] ↑ This announcement was used in-game before the introduction of Metro , however, is no longer used.

History [ ] 2017 21 December Newry added to the network as part of the Newry branch , as a Waterline terminus with 4 platforms, Platform 2 is a split platform with Platform 2A and 2B, Platform 2A is used for terminating services while Platform 2B is used for limited through services to Newry Harbour . New routes: R010 & Newry Harbour <> Greenslade 2018 21 April - Version 1.0 Added Waterline services to the Connolly branch . New routes: R011 & R012 Route removal: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade Removed from the game. 31 December - Version 1.1 Added Waterline services to the James Street branch . New route: R014 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Platform allocation is now randomised for P2A & 3. Bug : Trains cannot close doors at Platform 2A & B, unless there is a Guard . 18 December - Version 1.8.1 Bugfix : Trains now can close doors normally at Platform 2A & B. 2022 1 May Sneak peek for Newry's overhaul was released. Yet another station within Stepford County to receive a major overhaul! This one has received more than just a lick of paint! Coming Soon! 12 May Another sneak peek for Newry's overhaul was released, along with Stepford Express stopping at Newry showcased. And there you were thinking that our social media post on April 1st was a joke... Coming soon... 15 May - Version 1.9 Station overhauled, platforms decreased from 4 to 3, with Platform 2 no longer being a split platform. Now based on Newbury station . Platform changes: Platform 1 is now for terminating Waterline services only. Platform 2 & 3 can now serve as terminating platforms for both Waterline and Stepford Express , as well as through platforms for services to and from Newry Harbour respectively. Scenery upgrades around the station, with new commerical buildings. HST stop markers added to Platform 2 & 3. Added Stepford Express services to Newry Harbour, Leighton City and the Llyn-by-the-Sea branch via Benton and Morganstown . New route: R083 , R084 & R086 Bug : Trains entering Newry from Newry Harbour will be despawned by the message "Buffers don't like to be eaten". 17 May Bugfix : Trains can now enter Newry normally. 27 August - Version 1.10 Platform priorities added for terminating Waterline trains. EDQ P2 → NRY P1, then P2/3 Added Waterline services to Airport Terminal 2 and the Esterfield branch . Route change: R014 ( Newry <> James Street → Esterfield ) Now terminates at Esterfield. New routes: R017 & R018 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 2 & 3. 2025 9 September Bug : Trains may be despawned after departing Platform 3 by the message "Invalid section request". Trivia [ ] This station is based on Newbury station . This station has step-free access. Before V1.9 , Newry was one of the two stations to have platforms divided by letters, along with Morganstown . Before V1.9 , trains at Platform 2B could not depart until a Waterline service from Newry Harbour arrived on Platform 1, due to the fact that the stretch between Newry Harbour and Newry is single-tracked. However, such a situation rarely occurred as very few drivers chose to drive R012 , the only service calling at Newry Harbour at the time. This can still happen at the current version of Newry, where trains will have to wait at Platform 3 if Newry Harbour either has both its platforms occupied or there is a train in the single-track section. In one of BanTech 's livestreams, the developers said that there is a possibility for a Newry Depot. However, a siding was materialized instead of a depot. This was one of the only three stations that was still using old banner repeaters along with St Helens Bridge and Bodin . These banner repeaters were later replaced in V1.4.1 . There is a station in real life with the same name in Northern Ireland. This station is one of four multi-line through stations that are always stopped at by every route that approaches it, with the others being Stepford Central , Benton and and Stepford Airport Central . This station is one of three stations served by Stepford Express but not Stepford Connect , the other two being Newry Harbour and Eden Quay . Before The Big Update , a sign at the entrance of the station stated that services went to 'Rose Dale Head', which later became Connolly . Some have predicted that a station in the James Street Extension may take that name, similar to how Beechley took City Hospital 's old name and Willowfield took Financial Quarter 's old name. This was partially confirmed with the opening of Rosedale Village in V1.10 . In V1.8.0 , there was a bug where trains could not close doors at Platforms 2A and 2B, making Newry Harbour inaccessible unless the train skipped Newry. This could be temporarily circumvented if the train has a Guard . Platforms 1 and 3 still worked as intended and doors could be closed. The same bug also happened at Morganstown Platform 5A and 5B. The bug was fixed in V1.8.1. When the first sneak peek for Newry's overhaul in V1.9 was released, even though the station's name was not confirmed at the time, the community highly speculated this station to be Newry. Some have also suspected the sneak peek is James Street instead, but the commercial buildings shown in the background are located near Newry, which made this less likely to be true. Later, a second sneak peek was released on 12 May 2022, which revealed that Stepford Express will be stopping and going to Newry and Newry Harbour . Furthermore, this also confirmed that the previous sneak peek is Newry (due to OFF indicators showing it is between " Harbour " and " Eden Quay "). This also explains the passing tracks in the previous sneak peek. Though after V1.9 released, the passing tracks are unused, possibly reserved for use in future updates.

History [ ] 2017 21 December Newry Harbour was added to the network as part of the Newry branch , as a limited Waterline terminus with 1 platform only. There is only a single track leading up to this station. On the same day, this station was made to allow diesel trains only to reduce congestion, banning the Class 387 temporarily. New route: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade 2018 21 April - Version 1.0 Added Waterline services to the Connolly branch . New route: R012 Route removal: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade Removed from the game. 4 December Sneak peek for Newry Harbour's scenery upgrade was released. welcome to Day 4!

And there you were thinking that our social media post on April 1st was a joke... Coming soon... 15 May - Version 1.9 Station overhauled, platforms increased from 1 to 2. Now based on Kyle of Lochalsh station . Scenery near the station was upgraded, including a cruise ship near the harbour, connected to the harbour the station is on. Added Stepford Express services to the Llyn-by-the-Sea branch via Benton . New route: R084 Bug : Trains entering Newry from Newry Harbour will be despawned by the message "Buffers don't like to be eaten". 17 May Bugfix : Trains can now enter Newry normally. 27 August - Version 1.10 HST stop markers added to Platform 1 & 2. Added Waterline services to Farleigh . New route: R018 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 1 & 2. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 EMUs can no longer enter Newry Harbour. New route: R120 Trivia [ ] This station is based off the real life Kyle of Lochalsh station in the Highlands, northern Scotland. Prior to The Big Update , this station served Waterline services to and from Greenslade as Connolly was not in the game back then. For now, passengers willing to go to Greenslade should change at Newry , Benton or Morganstown Docks . Before Version 1.9 : This was the smallest station in SCR . This was one of the three stations in the game that only had 1 platform. The second one is Airport Terminal 1 and the third one is Leighton West . It was the only station in all of SCR to have the platform made entirely out of bricks. The station barely had any traffic, as Waterline was also not often driven by players then. This station's overhaul was not sneak peeked, but because of the overhaul of Newry and the confirmed extension of Stepford Express in Version 1.9 , it was highly anticipated for an overhaul. Due to the single track leading to this station, trains inbound to this station are forced to wait at Newry to allow outbound trains to free up the line. Waiting times of around three minutes may occur, however are unlikely since the station, if not the entirety of the Waterline network, remains seldom visited by drivers . This is the only limited service station that is a terminus. In V1.1 , scenery for this station was updated, adding many commercial buildings including a customs and shipping centre. These buildings still exist but were moved along with new scenery in Version 2.0 . It was originally intended that services to James Street would run from here, but the developers wanted to keep the station "tiny" in every way possible: the number of platforms and the number of services that arrive there. Ironically in V1.9 , a second platform was added, and Stepford Express services started to call here. And in V1.10 , a route was added to terminate at the new Farleigh station, one stop past James Street , where trains were originally meant to terminate at prior to the extension. There is a commercial building nearby named "Haughton Foundry", the name of the group that made Mind the Gap . This is one of the only stations with one track leading to it (alongside the Rayleigh Bay Branch , Airport Terminal 1 and Leighton West ). This station, alongside Morganstown Docks , were the only two stations that had dashed lines on the system map before V1.6 . This station was served mostly by 4-car Waterline trains since The Big Update , which were the Class 165/1 , Class 319 and Class 379 . The Class 387 served this station until it got moved to AirLink , and the Class 701 also served this station until it got removed in V1.1 . After the release of V2.0 , EMUs, namely Class 319 and Class 379 , are restricted from driving into this station, as electrification equipment is not implemented at this section. Also, the introduction of R120 , encourages 2-car trains serving this station. Near this station, there are tracks under a portal crane near a port, that include killblocks and buffers . This, the so-called "Platform 0" at Stepford Central (before a functioning Platform 0 was added at the station) and the addition of the static Class 66 Locomotives being added to Stepford Airport Parkway in V1.10 have made many players expecting a Freight line in SCR, though the developers have revealed nothing about this or if it will happen. Though this may all just be for scenery purposes only, as Stepford Airport Parkway is heavily based on the real life station Bristol Parkway , which has a freight siding next to it. In V1.6 , the route maps (both the Waterline one and the whole network one) labelled this stop as a station with limited service, probably due to a very small number of trains calling here. This station is one of two stations on the Waterline map to be considered limited service, the other being Rosedale Village . Prior to V1.10 , this station was the only limited service Waterline station. In contrary, after the Morganstown Shuttle of Waterline was introduced in V1.6 , though there are also not many trains serving the Morganstown Shuttle service, the Waterline map did not label Morganstown as a station with a limited service. [ note 1 ] However, in V1.10 , James Street also became a limited-service station [ note 2 ] , and a new limited-service station opened, Rosedale Village . In V1.9 , a cruise ship was added to the harbour along with the station's overhaul. However, it is solely for scenery purposes. This is the only place where players can see a cruise ship. Others are either container ships or private yachts. The river that empties to the left of Newry Harbour is the same river that cuts through downtown Stepford and Houghton Rake (though now not-fully covered by ground and tunnel), therefore the player can actually walk from Newry Harbour to Houghton Rake all the way to Stepford Central and Stepford Victoria by only following this river. Before reaching Houghton Rake , there is a branch that becomes its own river, the same river that cuts through St Helens Bridge . This station does not have electrification and thus can be only accessed by diesel-powered trains. However, before Version 2.0 , electric trains were allowed to drive into this station. Before The Big Update the station had diesel-only service, the Class 387 (operated by Waterline at the time) could not enter Newry Harbour, only allowing Class 165 and Class 166 trains. Notes [ ] ↑ A limited-service station often means that trains could have stopped at the limited-service station, but does not. Example being Rosedale Village , where R014 ( Newry <> Esterfield ) could have stopped there, but skips it instead. Being a limited-service station also requires at least two routes passing/stopping at that station, with at least 50% of the routes not stopping at it. Therefore, Morganstown is not considered as a limited-service station as all services that run there ( R015 and R120 ) stop here. In addition, Morganstown is also a major station. ↑ Even though James Street is shown as a limited service-station on the main network map but not on the Waterline operator map, it is to show clearly that there are services that skips James Street on the main network map. Though because 2 of the 3 routes stop at this station (and not less than 50% of routes, as mentioned above), this station is not shown as limited in the Waterline operator map.

New routes: R083 & R085 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 2 & 3. 2024 7 May Sneak peek for Northshore's upgrade was released. Who put that Gantry there! 12 August - Version 2.0 Northshore is now managed by Stepford Express instead of Stepford Connect . Station upgraded, now includes The Lounge as well as scenery improvements. Northshore is no longer shown in the intro , replaced by Faymere Green TMD . Added Stepford Connect & Stepford Express services to Rayleigh Bay . New routes: R050 & R087 Trivia [ ] This station resembles Stockport railway station , although its location is similar to Dawlish railway station and Colwyn Bay railway station . This station is step-free as of V1.9 . Before that, it was the only Stepford Express station that did not have step-free access to any of its platforms. It was also previously one of the three Stepford Connect stations that did not have wheelchair access to platforms. The other two are Water Newton and Stepford Airport Parkway . But in V1.10 and V2.0 respectively, both stations have been made step-free as well. This is the first, and so far the only station to be directly connected to a beach or an ocean. Starryloch does not count, as the player is required to take the footbridge in order to get next to the beach. This station, along with Starryloch and Llyn-by-the-Sea , is roughly parallel to the Stepford Central - Morganstown - Leighton Stepford Road line. Before V1.7.2, this station was one of two stations that had a Platform 0, the other being Stepford Airport Central . After that, the platforms were changed from 0, 1, 2, 3 to 1, 2, 3, 4 and a Platform 0 was added to Llyn-by-the-Sea . This station has been praised by numerous players, as they say it has a very modern design. Northshore is the only elevated station on the Llyn line. This was the third station to have the National Rail Double Arrow symbol with its station name displayed at the entrances. This can also be found at Stepford Airport Central , Rosedale Village and Westercoast . Formerly, Leighton Stepford Road also shared this trait, but it was removed with the station remodelling in V1.8 . Northshore is one of the best places for sunset viewing, due to its empty beach and the ocean exit facing southwest. With V1.7.2, Northshore gained a passing track for Stepford Express services towards Stepford Central , being one of the three stations that has a passing track going in one direction. The other two are Elsemere Junction and Angel Pass . This station's distance from Starryloch is bizarre, as unlike other stations on the Llyn branch, it is less than a mile away, therefore it is prone to being overshot and on rare occasions skipped entirely by accident since most stations on the Llyn branch require trains to go at high speeds and long distances to get to the next station. Before V2.0 , this station still had Metro -red theming with all other stations having generic white or black or coloured to their main operator. This was eventually replaced with Stepford Express theming. This was the last place in SCR to retain the first version of the ticket machine decals , which were still seen at the beach entrance to the station. Eventually, they were replaced by the new meshed (second and current version) ticket machine decals. The first version of these decals were last seen in Northshore . The Information signs in the main concourse still have the old Stepford Express colour scheme. This was removed with the upgrade in V2.0 . The lamps at the beach entrance to this station are one of the last lamp models from before V1.4.1 . The same models can also be found at most Tramlink stops and at the ramp leading to Westercoast station. The old lamp prop in Northshore. Northshore is the third station to be operated by Stepford Express , after Leighton Stepford Road and Westwyvern . As well as the fourth station to have a lounge . Prior to Version 2.0 , it was one of the three Stepford Connect -managed stations that are served by Stepford Express , the others being Edgemead and Westercoast . The Stepford Connect station sign at the western entrance of Northshore station. Oddly, a Stepford Connect station sign could still be found near the station's car park in V2.0 , even though the station is now operated by Stepford Express . Additionally, dispatchers spawned at this station would still wear the Stepford Connect -branded uniforms. These were fixed in V2.0.1. The Northshore Depot is accessible from this station.

However, due to the cancellation of Metro, the station was demolished in The Big Update . Return speculation [ ] With Metro 's return in Version 2.2 , many players speculated that the original Metro Loop could return along with the previously proposed stations. However, the Metro Loop did not return and a new loop including Coxly Newtown was added instead. It is unknown if an introduction of the Metro Loop is planned in the future. Trivia [ ] This station was part of the former Metro Loop , which has been demolished as part of The Big Update . The only stations which remained in the game were Stepford Victoria , City Hospital (under the name Beechley) and Willowfield (nowadays Financial Quarter ). These stations would later become the Stepford Victoria Branch .

New routes: R015 , R032 & R035 2021 17 October Sneak peek for Port Benton's overhaul was released. It's already #SneakPeekSunday again! A few other bits and bobs coming to v1.8, including a station overhaul and another train upgrade! 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled, new station building, platforms are now open instead of being indoors. Lift access added, Port Benton is now fully step-free. Platform 2 & 3 swapped roles, P2 now serves Waterline services to Benton and P3 serves Stepford Connect services instead. 2022 15 May - Version 1.9 Stepford Express services can now pass this station (does not stop). 27 August - Version 1.10 Bug : Stepford Connect trains cannot terminate at Platform 3. 2023 15 January - Version 1.10.3 Bugfix : Stepford Connect trains can now terminate again. 2 April - Version 1.10.7 New route: R047 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added Waterline services to Newry Harbour . New route: R120 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Platform 3 can now serve as a bypass/overflow to Platform 2. Added Metro services. New route: R137 Trivia [ ] Port Benton and Morganstown Docks are only 0.17 miles (0.27 kilometres) apart, the shortest distance between two stations in the whole SCR network. As a result, the "Welcome onboard..." announcement plays immediately after "We will shortly be arriving...". Before Waterline services started calling here, Port Benton only had one Platform that was isolated from the rest of the line. This made it the smallest station in the game until the Waterline services opened. Port Benton, Airport Terminal 2 and Morganstown are the only stations where Dispatchers can dispatch both Stepford Connect and Waterline services. Players can walk from Port Benton to Morganstown Docks via road. Prior to V1.7 , players could also walk to Benton , Benton Bridge and Cambridge Street Parkway by road before the Benton District's redevelopment cut off access. This is the only Stepford Connect managed station that is served by Metro and Waterline . Before V1.5 , where Waterline was a subfranchise of Stepford Connect , Port Benton uniquely had white signs instead of the usual dark blue, suggesting it was "more Stepford Connect (Connect) than Waterline ". Additionally, Dispatcher spawned with the Connect uniform. Oddly, only one Stepford Connect route serve this station. Yet, Stepford Connect still manages this station as of V2.2 . Before V1.8 , the loop line from Port Benton to Benton was overgrown. It also used to have an old speed limit signs that seem to date back to the days of British Rail. This was removed in V1.9 . Before V1.7 , Port Benton was not near any port. After that, a major container port was added nearby to the station. Until its overhaul in V1.8 , this station did not have a concourse, and the main entrance was only a doorway to Platform 1. This station shares the headcode "P" with Stepford Airport Parkway . The other headcode sharing pairs of stations are Leighton Stepford Road and Rayleigh Bay (R), and Benton and Barton (B). Signals W016 and W018 on Platforms 2 and 3 going towards the Benton crossover have left feather indicators, which only light up when the train on these platforms is a Class 756 doing R137 . This is the only station in the Greenslade Branch that has Connect services. There is a bug that despawns a train that is leaving Platform 3 when heading to Benton from Morganstown Docks.

New route: R025 2020 29 October - Version 1.7 Added Stepford Connect services to Upper Staploe . New route: R039 2021 28 August Sneak peek for Rocket Parade's overhaul was released. 👀 Coming soon to an SCR near you! 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled, new station building. Resembles Five Ways station . No longer a limited-service station. Added Stepford Connect services to Leighton West and Llyn-by-the-Sea . Route changes: R003 ( Stepford Central <> Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City ) R039 ( Benton <> Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City ) Now terminates at Leighton City. New routes: R009 , R024 & R044 2022 27 February - Version 1.8.2 New route: R045 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Rocket Parade is no longer shown in the intro , replaced by Faymere Green TMD & Llyn-by-the-Sea . Trivia [ ] This station is based on Five Ways station , in Birmingham, England. This station has step-free access. Across from this station is BanTech Systems HQ. BanTech Systems used to work in association with Charlie_RBX , the former Managing Director , to develop Stepford County Railway as an Innovations Director . Prior to V1.1 , this station was the only limited-service station on the network . This station is discretely named after BanTech, the " Rocket " in Rocket Parade is a reference to the fact that BanTech studied rocket science at university. "Parade" is a common suffix. This station was the only one to remain in every iteration of the intro to the game. As the BanTech Systems Headquarters is outside this station, and SCR is a collaboration with BanTech Systems. However following BanTech 's resignation as Innovations Director , Rocket Parade has since been removed from V2.0 onwards. Before V1.8 , players could walk from here to Leighton Stepford Road . Players can still walk from here to Leighton Depot but the road cuts off right before reaching Leighton Stepford Road . The only way to get towards Leighton Stepford Road is by jumping over a fence. Strangely, there are no platform number signs at this station. This station has a lift to both platforms, but only Platform 2 has a direct lift from the concourse, while Platform 1 has a separate lift. Both lifts are connected with a footbridge on the mezzanine floor. Before the Leighton Zone replaced Winstree , it was located right where BanTech Systems HQ currently is, near this station. In a Directors Q&A on 23 October 2021, Managing Director Charlie_RBX has stated that more services will be scheduled to stop here in V1.8 . Eventually, R009 and R024 started calling here in V1.8, and this station is no longer considered as limited-service station. Even though it is no longer a limited-service station, there are still a few Stepford Connect routes that skip it, such as R004 and R035 . There is a big commercial building near Rocket Parade called RLSJ's Tuition Centre , however the building was not present in the sneak peek of the station's overhaul.

Rosedale Village is only served by 1 route, being R016 ( Benton <> Esterfield ). The other route to Esterfield , R014 ( Newry <> Esterfield ) , skips this station.

History [ ] 2022 27 August - Version 1.10 Rosedale Village added to the network as part of the Waterline extension , as a limited-service Waterline through station, with services to Benton and Esterfield only. Resembles Stansted Mountfitchet station . New route: R016 Trivia [ ] This station resembles Stansted Mountfitchet station in Essex. This station was never sneak peeked prior to its release. Prior to Version 2.0 , this was one of two stations to be considered limited service on the Waterline map, the other being Newry Harbour . In V1.10 , this station, along with James Street , were the first two stations to be skipped by Waterline services, as R014 ( Newry <> Esterfield ) skips both stops. The name 'Rosedale' comes from Connolly 's planned name, 'Rose Dale Head'. This is a similar situation to Willowfield and Beechley which were both the planned names for Financial Quarter and City Hospital respectively. This is the only Waterline station to not get Waterline services to Newry . Rosedale Village is barely used, as only R016 ( Benton <> Esterfield ) stops here. This makes it the only station to only have one route serving it (as of V2.2 ). Some players thought that the announcements for this station and Farleigh sounded unnatural as they did not fit well with other stations' announcements. Though Esterfield was not one of them as the announcements for the station was found as early as 2021, which was probably recorded together with the other stations. This station is the least used Waterline station and the second least used station in the entire game, according to the Hub Site . This station has the National Rail Double Arrow symbol on the southside entrance sign. It can also be found at Stepford Airport Central , Northshore and Westercoast . It is possible to walk to Water Newton from here via road without trespassing within a few minutes.

New routes: R130 , R131 , R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 , R136 & R137 Trivia [ ] This station resembles Stratford station , located in London. This station is one of the 4 stations on the network managed by Transport for Stepford . Along with Stepford Victoria , Stepford Central and Stepford East . Before the Whitefield branch was introduced in V1.2 , every Stepford Connect route stopped here. This is one of the few stations that use both banner repeaters and OFF indicators. This is one of the most popular dispatching locations in the game along with Stepford East . One dispatcher can dispatch the vast majority of Stepford Connect and Metro services, as well as some Stepford Express trains. Currently, this station is one of the 4 quadrouple-line junctions alongside Stepford Central , Elsemere Junction and Benton . The 77 arch-viaduct used by Stepford Express for services via Benton to the north-east of the station was built by FirstManchester135 and MAGICMOVIESTEAM1 . It took them 4 hours and 32 minutes to build (excluding breaks), according to a plaque that was placed on 24 November 2017 at 8:41 PM. The plaque has since been removed. This viaduct used to lack in scenery until V1.7 when a small village was added under the viaduct. The speed limit for Stepford Express trains used to be 75 MPH, but it was increased to 90 MPH. In V1.7 , a new arch-viaduct was made for Stepford Express trains that go via the Morganstown Branch . This station was on Mattyx2013 's sneak peek showing new game lighting. The new lighting at St Helens Bridge Platform 1 used to be hard to access from other platforms before the tunnel was added. Being quite far away, this required dispatchers to walk a while just to get between Platform 1 and Platform 2-4, causing potential delays. Out of any station, this station has the most stations that players can get to directly from it, at 10. Lots of extra spare rails and cables can be seen at the end of the tracks acting as scenery. Equipment laid on the ballast spelling out "T J H 4 4" At the end of Platform 4 & 5, some of the equipment spell out "T J H" with 4 cable reels and 4 lined up rails. This is a reference to the Community Director tjh44, who did the overhaul of the station. This station is one of the first stations to include Roblox immersive advertisements, released just a few days prior to the V1.10.7 update.

This is by far my favourite contribution to the game and I hope you love it as much as I do! 😍 17 December - Version 1.4 Starryloch added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms with 2 express tracks between. Resembles Dawlish Warren station . New route: R024 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 New route: R037 2021 19 February - Version 1.7.2 New route: R040 5 December - Version 1.8 Now a limited-service station. Added Stepford Connect services to Leighton West . New route: R042 Route removal: R037 No longer stops here. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 OHLE is now meshed. Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New route: R050 2025 6 October Sneak peek for Starryloch's upgrade in Version 2.3 was released. The first place to get a whole new 'loch'! Coming to SCR version 2.3 Trivia [ ] This station resembles Dawlish Warren station in Devon. The Class 68 / 444 exclusive routes, R026 and R036 , skip this station. However, they will still pass through the platforms while skipping this station, instead of using the Stepford Express passing tracks like Faymere . This is due to the two services having to call at Westwyvern and Northshore , and there are no points for them to switch to and from the express tracks between the two aforementioned stations. R037 (Leighton City <> Llyn-by-the-Sea) also skips this station. It is the only non-exclusive route to not stop here. Although this station is a limited service station, ironically 4 out of 7 Stepford Connect routes stop here. This is unrealistic especially considering that only 1 of the 3 routes that skip this station are non-exclusive. In the sneak peek for this station, you can distinctly see a purple train, which was later revealed to be a Class 43 . The shore starts coming into view near this station. On the platforms it is hard to see the shore as there is a forest between the station and beach. This station has an old-fashioned signal box, this is the Starryloch Signal Box . Before V1.7 , the signal box was purely for scenery and was non-functional. Between V1.7 and V1.7.2, the Zone E Signalling Desk was placed here before it was relocated to Llyn-by-the-Sea Rail Operations Centre Strangely, the empty signal box can still be accessed by Signallers in role. This is one of former Operations Director / Product Developer Mattyx2013's favourite stations, along with West Benton . On the Stepford Connect billboard, there is an advertisement for the commercial building , West Benton Pet Supplies. Other stations that used to have this ad were Leighton City and Whitefield Lido . Whitefield still has this advertisement. Although this station is not dispatchable, there are still OFF indicators here. This is also true for several stations, such as Rocket Parade and Millcastle Racecourse . It is speculated that the indicators were added to make guarding easier. Version 1.7.2 saw the footbridge extended to a sea wall, which you can walk along, as part of the scenery upgrade for Westwyvern . Because of this, it has become possible to walk between Starryloch and Westwyvern without having to step onto the baseplate. Platform 1 is featured in the SCR Prototyping Centre‎‎ and the SCR Concept stall at Transport Tech 2021 , which showcases a new guarding procedure with keybinds, plus a physical guard panel in the train, along with keybinds to sit and open doors. There is a caravan park which is a short walk from the station. On one of the holiday homes, there was an image of Zippy, a puppet featured on Rainbow , posted on a window. However, this has since been removed in V1.9 for unknown reasons (possibly because of copyright).

History [ ] 2017 25 November Stepford Airport Central added to the network, as a major terminus with 7 platforms. Platform 0-2 is for Stepford Connect and Platform 3-6 is for AirLink . Platform 3-6 remained unused until AirLink was opened later in Version 1.1 . New route: R001 2018 31 December - Version 1.1 Stepford Airport Central is no longer shown in the intro , replaced by Airport West . Added Stepford Connect services to Stepford Victoria ; and AirLink services to Stepford Central . New routes: R005 , R051 , R053 & R054 2019 1 February - Version 1.1.9 Added AirLink services to Airport Terminal 1 & 2 . New route: R052 Route change: R053 ( Stepford Central <> Stepford Airport Central → Airport Terminal 2 (via T1 ) (S) ) Now stops at Airport Terminal 1 & 2. 2 February - Version 1.1.10 Added AirLink services to Airport Terminal 3 . New route: R055 16 September - Version 1.3.26 (Five Million Update) Added AirLink services to Leighton Stepford Road . New routes: R056 & R057 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to Beechley . New route: R033 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Platform allocation is now randomised at P0-2 & 4-5. 2022 26 June Sneak peek for Stepford Airport Central's overhaul was released. The sun sets on the next newly renovated station for another addition to #SneakPeekSundays 27 August - Version 1.10 Station overhauled. Now based on Gatwick Airport station . A lounge was added. The Signal Zone C signalling desk is now located at this station. Platform changes: Platform 0-2 still serves as the Stepford Connect terminating platforms, but now also allows through services to Airport Terminal 2 . Platform 3-6 still mainly serves AirLink , however Platform 3 is no longer limited to through services and Platforms 4 & 5 are no longer limited to terminating trains, allowing for through services as well. Platform 6 remains for through services from Airport Terminal 2 , but now also allows Stepford Connect and AirLink trains from that station and Farleigh Depot Road 11. Added Stepford Connect services to Airport Terminal 2 . New routes: R046 , R059 & R060 2023 2 April - Version 1.10.7 New route: R048 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 3-6. Trivia [ ] The latest station model in Version 1.10 is based on Gatwick Airport station . This station is step-free. Stepford Airport Central is one of the few stations in SCR that has a Platform 0, and also one of the only stations that still have a Platform 0 since release. The only other stations (as of V2.0.1 ) to have a Platform 0 are Stepford Central and Llyn-by-the-Sea . The station looks much different with its second ( V1.0 ) and third ( V1.10 ) variant than it did prior to The Big Update . It had signs for what train arrived at the platform and it had a more futuristic design. This was one of the only few stations in the game that did not have a road near its entrance. The other stations with that trait at the time were Terminals 1 , 2 , 3 . This was changed in V1.10 , when the Airport Zone received an overhaul. Currently, the only station that does not have a road near its entrance is Airport Terminal 1 . This station is one of four multi-line through stations that are always stopped at by every route that approaches it, with the others being Stepford Central , Newry and Benton . Prior to the fix in V1.7 , in Stepford Connect 's map the name of this station was "Stepford Airport Central"; while in AirLink 's map it was just "Airport Central". This also happened to Stepford Airport Parkway . The user interface and the announcements also has this phenomenon, the user interface shows "Airport Central", while in the announcements , it is "Stepford Airport Central", for both station and onboard announcements. This also applies to other airport stops. Though this may be because the user interface cannot fit the whole station name, this is similar to Cambridge Street Parkway and Leighton Stepford Road where it is shown as “Cambridge St Pkwy” and “Leighton Step Rd” respectively. Before the Five Million Update , Stepford Central was the hub of all AirLink services. This station is now considered to be the AirLink hub. Although AirLink was been rebranded, an old sign at the station, could have been seen at the end of Platform 4. In V1.8 , the sign was replaced with the rebranded signage. This station has the largest rectangle station sign on the entire network. This station has the largest National Rail logo in the entire network, located on the roof of the station. This station is the third station to have a lounge , following Stepford Central and Llyn-by-the-Sea . The AirLink tunnel portal outside the station leading to Airport Terminal 1 is called "Airport T1 Portal Access".

Trivia [ ] Before Version 1.10 : This station's entrance was based on Luton Airport Parkway 's entrance. This station had step-free access for interchange only. This was because all the platforms were connected with a sloped footbridge, while the path towards the entrance had a short flight of stairs in the way. This station had 216 parking spaces, behind Cambridge Street Parkway with 234. No AirLink trains to and from Leighton Stepford Road called at this station, passengers had to go there via Stepford Airport Central . After Version 1.10 : The whole station is based off Bristol Parkway in real life. There is a freight siding next to the station near Platform 5 (Stepford Airport Parkway Freight Sidings), this is also based on real life as there is a depot near Bristol Parkway. The station was moved closer to Airport West , with Airport West being northwest of Stepford Airport Parkway. Out of Station Interchange (OSI) between the aforementioned stations. The amount of parking spaces was increased to 1,013, beating Cambridge Street Parkway by 779. R056 was changed to stop here, making services to Leighton Stepford Road available. This is one of only five stations to have an elevator that serves more than two floors, the others being Stepford Central , Elsemere Junction , Ashlan Park and Rocket Parade . This station and Cambridge Street Parkway are the only stations in SCR to have "Parkway" in their names. Prior to V1.10 , this was the last AirLink station without step-free access to its entrance. This was also one of the two Stepford Connect stations that did not have wheelchair access to platforms. At that point, Water Newton was the only station that did not have wheelchair access to any of its platforms, before it finally became step-free in V2.0 . The sneak peek of Stepford Airport Parkway's overhaul was the last sneak peak to be posted by Managing Director Charlie_RBX on the #sneak-peeks channel on Discord. This station shares the headcode "P" with Port Benton . The only other pairs of stations that share a headcode are Leighton Stepford Road and Rayleigh Bay , which both share the "R" headcode and Benton and Barton , which both share the "B" headcode.

The station was also AirLink 's hub, but later it was transferred to Stepford Airport Central in the Five Million Update due to the opening of the extension to Leighton Stepford Road . Prior to The Big Update , this station was known as Stepford Town . The new name was decided on by the players in a vote on the SCR Discord server. The other options were Stepford City, or to keep the name. Before Angel Pass was added, only Platforms 1-3 were used. After that, they were left vacant until Stepford Express came out in V1.4 and began using those platforms. This is the terminus of the Stepford Main Line. The line that goes beyond Stepford Central to Stepford Victoria is called the Stepford Victoria Branch and the line goes beyond Stepford Central to Willowfield is called the Willowfield Branch . Until V1.1 , only Platforms 4-7 were used, and it was a very quiet station as Stepford Depot did not exist, plus very few routes existed at that time. In addition, AirLink and Stepford Express were not released at the time. The concourse to Platform 11 was closed before V1.1 due to construction purposes, as well as no trains using that platform. Platforms 12 to 15 opened and were assigned to the newly-opened AirLink line which opened in V1.1 . As of the V1.4 update, all platforms at this station are in use. In the V1.4.1 update, this station got revamped with a shortened rainshed above Platforms 1-11. This station was lacking lights prior to this update. A siding near Platform 1 was added in V1.4.1 . It stayed unused for a long time until it finally became Platform 0 in V2.0.1 . In the V1.4.4 update, this station got a major revamp, made by yrrebRBLX, featuring a complete redesign which includes 3 new entrances (Taxi Rank, The Arches and South Concourse), management offices and the Stepford ROC . The default entrance became Approach Road. The station was reconstructed with a modular approach, which makes navigation around the station easier. Platform 11 and all AirLink platforms are secured by ticket barriers after this update. The Rail Operations Centre was relocated here. A first class AirLink lounge was also added but only completed in Version 1.7 , revealed in BanTech's revamped signalling video. Some original structures, like the Main Concourse seating area, remained after the update. The platform layout was unchanged, though they are now curved. In V2.0 , a new entrance for platforms 1-11 was added near the Taxi Rank, The Arches and South Concourse spawn points. However, this entrance was only accessible using stairs. In V2.0.1 , the unused siding was converted into platform 0 for terminating Stepford Express services. In V2.1 .3, a small part of the escalators to the Taxi Rank got removed and replaced by walls, and a new entrance also got added. You can't spawn there and it doesn't have a name yet. In V2.2 , 4 new platforms were introduced for Metro , being platforms A,B,C,D Station layout [ ] }} Click the arrow on the right to see the station layout.

Trivia [ ] This station was formerly based solely on Manchester Piccadilly , however after its renovation in V1.4.4, it is now also based on not only Manchester Piccadilly, but also London Waterloo (Platforms 12-15 are inspired by Waterloo's platforms 20-24). This station is one of eight stations in SCR operated by Transport for Stepford . This is the station with most entrances, at 5. Central Mall was the primary entrance until V1.4.4, when the Approach Road entrance was added and became the default entrance. As of Version 2.0 , Central Mall was demolished and made way for the new Main Approach. The original Approach Road entrance was renamed to the AirLink side. Prior to V1.9 , every Stepford Express route stopped at this station. Now, only 62% (or 8 out of 13) of routes stop here. [ note 1 ] The Concourses' locations are still similar to the old one, except for the South Concourse, which did not exist before V1.4.4. This is one of the stations which feature curved platforms. They were added in V1.4.4. Between V1.4.4 and V1.4.5, trains on Platforms 4-9 would shake if they were departing and another train arrived at the station. At the old Central Mall entrance, players could see the mall and a square located right before it. And at the Taxi Rank entrance, there are bays for taxis. This scenery really makes any passengers going into the station feel like they are actually in a city. At the Taxi Rank entrance, there is a large, brown-brick building labelled as Great Stepford Railway. This could be a former name for Transport for Stepford . The SCR Headquarters was relocated a bit away from this station in V1.4.4 to allow more space for the station building which was made bigger. Qualified Driver Trainings were formerly conducted here, before being relocated to Stepford East ROC during V1.1 . However, after Version 1.4.4, they were relocated back to be held here at an entrance point (more specifically, Central Mall ). Since V1.10.4, these trainings are now held in a separate purpose-built training map. Managers ' and Directors ' Offices are located here as of V1.4.4. Most of them are inside the Management Office above the AirLink Concourse at the south end of the station, while the office for Innovations Director is opposite, which is located at the north end of the station, next to Stepford ROC , and the office of Signaller Manager and Operations Manager are on the right side of the ROC, while Community Director and Operations Director offices are on the left side of the ROC. This was the first station in SCR to have a lounge . The other stations that have a lounge are Airport Central , Northshore , Westwyvern and Llyn-by-the-sea . The '???' feature on the former roadmap was accidentally removed when the station was upgraded, leading some to believe that that was the secret update, as there was no announcement about it. The '???' ultimately turned out to be the introduction of the new role, Guards , in V1.5 . Trains from Stepford Depot can go to almost all 16 platforms at this station. Platform 10 cannot be accessed from the depot as it is an eastbound only platform. It is faster to walk than taking a train from here to Stepford Victoria . Another major station, Morganstown , has all 5 operators serving it but having 9 less (or twice as less) platforms than Stepford Central (if counting Platform 5A and 5B as seperate platforms). This station is one of four multi-line through stations that are always stopped at by every route that approaches it, with the others being Newry , Stepford Airport Central and Benton . This is one of two stations to have a set of two elevators, the other one being at Airport Central , on platforms 5 and 6. When going to Platforms 0-10 from Airlink Side, or vice versa, the player actually passes through ticket barriers three times. Despite being the largest station in the game, Stepford Central is not a junction station. As of Version 2.0.1, this is one of three stations to have a Platform 0, the others being Airport Central and Llyn by the Sea . In very early versions of the game, there was what appeared to be a Class 390 stationary on the ground beside the station, as found at 4:35 in the YouTube video, " Stepford County Railway: Benton - Stepford Town (Oldest recorded SCR gameplay) ". The train in question This station has entrance with bike racks near the Main Approach Entrance. SECRET BADGE 1 There is an Easter Egg at this station. Spawn as a passenger at the Main Approach Entrance of this station, then go down to Stece_Sama statue and walk to the arches. There is a narrow way between a wall and the bridge. Players can see a 9-¾ sign at the end. They can pass through the wall of the bridge where it's attached. After passing through it, the player can see a huge empty room and a wall with the text "An easter egg? But it's not easter yet! I guess BanTech just likes to mess around. Welcome to the big empty space under Stepford Central! Touch me for a free badge". When they touch the wall, they will get the badge "I wonder what's in here...", and the text on the wall will change to "Hehe, that tickles" SECRET BADGE 2 Players can get another badge after spawning at South Concourse and walking to the statue of a person holding a globe. If a player climbs the statue, they will get the The Weight of the World badge . The person has a teapot on his head because the person is yrrebRBLX (a former Product Developer ). Notes [ ] ↑ Stepford Central is in third place, tied with Llyn-by-the-Sea with 62% (or 8 out of 13) of routes; behind Benton and Leighton Stepford Road with 69% (or 9 out of 13); and Leighton City with 77% (or 10 out of 13).

This won the first Community Spotlight hosted in May 2025. 'Your new operator' by bnincl Trivia [ ] This station is based on London Bridge Station in London, UK . A new depot was built next to this station in V1.1 . It is used by Stepford Connect and AirLink (and later Stepford Express ). The old Stepford East Rail Operations Centre was located next to this station. It was attached to the station, and the entrance to the building was at the High Street entrance. It was moved to Stepford Central in Version 1.4.4 Signallers could have still entered the old ROC as the barriers were still working. It was eventually removed in V1.6 and replaced by a tall building. The entrance at High Street was sealed off. This station is one of four station which are operated by Transport for Stepford , as they are located within the Stepford District. The others are Stepford Victoria , Stepford Central and St Helens Bridge . It is also the only Transport for Stepford station that has no terminating platforms. This is one of the most popular dispatching stations due to the fact that one Dispatcher can dispatch all the Stepford Connect trains that stop here. However, there is typically no AirLink Dispatcher unless AirLink is being " flooded ". Upon the release of V1.4 , as Stepford Express does not stop here, the popularity decreased and transferred to St Helens Bridge as both Stepford Connect and Stepford Express can be dispatched at St Helens Bridge . It is still common to find Dispatchers at Stepford East's Stepford Connect platforms though. This station is also a very popular station for passengers as it is one of the busiest stations in the game, as well as it being a good place to trainspot passing Stepford Express services and trains coming out of the nearby Stepford Depot . Additionally, the frequent appearance of a Dispatcher here makes it a more social station. There was at one point a bug that would cause Dispatchers to be flung by departing trains, requiring Dispatchers to respawn. This is caused by the quirks ROBLOX physics engine, and is no longer possible due the updated train movement system. Due to a good network of roads in the area, it is possible to walk to all stations in Stepford City and even Elsemere Pond . However, it is impossible to walk to Elsemere Junction or Whitefield Lido from here. Before V1.6 , it was impossible to walk to Stepford Central from here. This station is the largest through-only station on the network. This station was the first in the game to have a >7 car stop marker . There are 6-7 car Stop Markers on the Stepford Connect platforms, and further S Stop Marker , though no train used the former until the Class 717 with 6 cars was released in Version 1.8.2 . In Version 2.2 , however, all Class 717 units were transferred to Metro operator, once again leaving them unused. The S Stop Markers still remain unused, unless a player overshoots the correct stop marker. In V1.8 , 7-8 car stop markers were added to AirLink platforms, hinting future 7 and 8 coach trains on AirLink . In V2.1 , these were used by the double Class 387 . Stepford East was the only station to have 8 car stop markers in the network until V1.10 , when they were also added to Stepford Airport Parkway and Stepford Airport Central .

History [ ] 2019 28 April - Version 1.2 Stepford High Street added to the network as part of the Whitefield extension , as a Stepford Connect through station with a very curved island platform. New routes: R020 , R021 , R022 & R023 22 February - Version 1.4.1 Added OFF indicators and Stepford Connect signs. Removed the Metro red. 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Station overhauled. Concourse now consists of glass walls with concourse information boards and seating added to the station. New route: R031 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Added OHLE. Route change: R022 ( Stepford Victoria → Beechley <> Whitefield ) Now terminates at Beechley. No longer stops at Stepford Victoria , Financial Quarter , City Hospital , Whitefield Lido & Houghton Rake . 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Additional OFF indicators have been added for better visibility. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Stepford High Street is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. New Metro platforms opened underground, but the elevated platform has been abandoned. Route removals: R020 , R022 No longer stops here. New routes: R002 , R006 , R008 , R027 , R030 , R034 , R130 , R132 , R133 , R135 , R136 & R137 Trivia [ ] This station before Version 2.2, served as a landmark for trainspotters, as it is said to give the perfect passer-by view of the Stepford Main Line 's diverse traction. This station used to have no mark on the Network Map . Prior to Version 2.2 , this station was jokingly referred to as the "90 degree station" due to its platforms curving 90°. Some players used to report lag issues at the station, likely because of the 90 degree curve and many parts were overlapping into each other, causing z-fighting , which in turn, causes lag. Because of the curve, the station had very big gaps (at some places) between trains and the platform. Many Dispatchers and Guards disliked the station because the sharp curve makes it difficult to easily complete the procedure. The strange placement of OFF indicators does not help this. The curved platform of this station was similar to Platforms 5 and 6 at Ebbsfleet International station on High Speed 1. As of Version 2.2 , The platforms A and B are still curved 90° since they serve services to/from Stepford United Football Club . Due to this, Dispatchers were able to dispatch a train on an adjacent platform (i.e. Dispatching the train on Platform 1 on Platform 2), as this improves visibility for dispatching on curved platforms. This station has step-free access. This station used to be elevated when it was managed by Stepford Connect . The elevated platform is now abandoned with the entrance blocked off and the new underground entrance placed right behind the old one. The Connect station sign was replaced to "Do not alight here". It is the only station sign to be self-illuminated as typical station sign would be illuminated using street light. Players can still access the abandoned platforms via trespassing. Stepford High Street Shopping Centre is located just west of the station. This station offers access to the High Street Metro Signalling Centre and Stepford High Street Head Office. Oddly enough, this station used to have no ticket machines. Players can walk from this station to Stepford East and St Helens Bridge without trespassing. This station is one of the two stations to not have a sign with its name in the entire network , alongside Four Ways . Notes [ ] ↑ This announcement was used in-game before the introduction of Metro , however, is no longer used.

Stepford Southgate Operational Information Served by Managed by Metro Metro (Presumably) Station code SSO Station Information Platforms 2 Tracks 2 Service Information Preceding station Following station St Helens South University Stepford Southgate was a proposed station to be part of Metro and High Speed. However, due to the cancellation of both operators, the station was demolished in The Big Update . Return speculation [ ] With Metro 's return in Version 2.2 , many players speculated that the original Metro Loop could return along with the previously proposed stations. However, the Metro Loop did not return and a new loop including Coxly Newtown was added instead. It is unknown if an introduction of the Metro Loop is planned in the future. Trivia [ ] This station was part of the Metro Loop , which has also been demolished within The Big Update except Stepford Victoria and Beechley ( Financial Quarter ), which became the Stepford Victoria Branch . Prior to The Big Update , Stepford Southgate was never actually completed. If the player was to go there in the Legacy Version of Stepford County Railway , they would find an empty platform between St Helens South and University . Notes [ ]

This is my second contribution to the SCR Dev Team! This next station is a little bigger than my last one but here it is. 😁 28 April - Version 1.2 Stepford United Football Club added to the network as part of the Whitefield extension , as a Stepford Connect through station as well as a terminus, serving a football stadium. Resembles Darlington Station . Platform 1 & 4 are through platforms while Platform 2 & 3 are bay platforms. Dispatcher and Guard trainings are held here. New routes: R020 , R021 , R022 & R023 2020 1 May - Version 1.5 Dispatcher trainings are no longer held here. Now held at Faymere . Guard trainings are now held here. However later moved to Faymere as well. 22 June - Version 1.6 Station overhauled. New roof design, but the overall structure remains the same, with some colour changes. Guard trainings are now held here again. Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R031 20 August - Version 1.6.5 Dispatcher trainings are now held here again. 2021 7 July - Version 1.7.4 Dispatcher trainings are no longer held here. Now at held Willowfield . 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled. Roof has been removed. No longer resembles Darlington Station . Platform 1 & 2 are now bay platforms and Platform 3 & 4 are now through platforms. New training briefing centre added next to the station. Dispatcher trainings are now held here again. Added OHLE. Platform allocation is now randomised at P1-2. Route change: R022 ( Stepford Victoria → Beechley <> Whitefield ) Now terminates at Beechley. No longer stops at Stepford Victoria , Financial Quarter , City Hospital , Whitefield Lido & Houghton Rake . 2023 6 March - Version 1.10.4 Dispatcher and Guard trainings are no longer held here with the new training map. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Stepford UFC is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer terminates here. New route: R103 Trivia [ ] Before V1.6 , this station used to resemble Darlington Station in Darlington, UK. There is a football stadium outside the station. This was made by former Signaller Manager billythepet . Before V1.8 , the stadium was to the west of the station. After it, the stadium and car-park were moved to the east of the station. After the overhaul in V1.8 , this station has been disliked by some of the community, due to the station looking more generic and the unique roof being removed. Before V1.4.4, this station resembled the old Stepford Central , but was significantly smaller, and only had 4 platforms instead of 15. Before trespassers found this station before Version 1.2 was officially released, many players presumed this station, and others previewed, were along the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension. Pre-season matches occurred for a big season after the release of this station. As a result, Stepford UFC merch was previewed in the SCR Official Discord. This was the first station to be near a stadium. And along with Millcastle Racecourse , they are the only stations to have a stadium nearby. The stadium at Millcastle Racecourse is the only one to not be purposed for football games, being purposed for horse racing instead. This station had an advertisement for Waterline that was unique to it. It featured Eden Quay . It was removed in V1.4.6. A remade version of the advertisement was added in V1.7.1. The new version of the advertisement is no longer exclusive to Stepford UFC. This station used to be two wide staircases leading up to two bay platforms with two underpasses between them in SCR Legacy . Pedestrian routes to Whitefield Lido and Woodhead Lane are made possible by a road that runs parallel to the tracks. This station has the longest station name when fully extended with 29 characters. The longest single word station names are Westercoast , Willowfield and Morganstown , with 11 characters. Stepford UFC has 12 characters when condensed. Dispatcher and Guard trainings once took place here. After V1.8 , the sign at the end of the terminating tracks that said "Welcome to Stepford United Football Club" was removed. A similar sign can still be found at the Willowfield station exit. There is a rusty lamp post lying in the bushes between Platforms 2 and 3. According to former Product Developer Mattyx2013 , some angry football fans "threw it out". To the west of the station, there are some strange cut-out grey baseplates forming a circle. These are supposedly from the pre- V1.8 Stepford UFC station. One of these supposed roads even connects to Hemdon Park . One of the signs of this station is floating above the platform. This station is often nicknamed as "Stepford KFC", a spinoff based on its similar spelling with the global fried chicken fast food chain KFC.

Addition of meshed OHLE and new station object models. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Added Metro services to Barton (via EMJ ) and Morganstown (via BEN ) . New routes: R136 & R137 Trivia [ ] The station resembles London Charing Cross , but the entrance to the station is very different to its real life counterpart. This station has step-free access. This station opened in V1.1 , which was released on the 31st of December 2018. This station is operated by Transport for Stepford . Along with most stations located near Stepford, where most Stepford Connect stations co-operate with Transport for Stepford . The other 7 stations which are also operated by Transport for Stepford are Stepford Central , Stepford East , St Helens Bridge , Morganstown , Benton , Leighton City and Llyn-by-the-Sea . Originally, this station was going to serve an operator called High Speed, which would have used a line adjacent to the Stepford Main Line to get onto the Morganstown Branch , where trains would have then used the then-unused southern section of a triangle junction at Morganstown to get back onto the Stepford Main Line . However, plans changed and the original route was demolished. The station was also planned to be on the Metro Loop , which was cancelled. The station was completely rebuilt in V1.1 , and the Tramlink stop adjacent to the station had to be demolished to make way for the new concourse. It is most common to see the free Class 357 and Class 717 trains here due to the Stepford Victoria to Stepford Airport Central ( R005 ), Stepford United Football Club ( R023 ) and Leighton City ( R045 ) routes starting here, as they are the free starter routes. Prior to V1.4 , this station had purple information boards, which made people think that Stepford Express would serve here. Prior to V1.6 , this station had no seats and ticket barriers. Despite this station having more platforms than average, it is rare for more than three of them to be occupied at once. This station lacks in detail with little to no scenery near the station. This station is exactly parallel to Stepford Central and can be seen from Stepford Central with a high enough render distance and vice-versa. Prior to V1.8 , there was a "secret" route to Llyn-by-the-Sea that was not shown on the line map that starts at Stepford Victoria. It was R026 , in which the occurrence of the route was rare as it is exclusive to the Class 68 , the most expensive train in SCR that not many people own. As of V1.8 , the route is now shown on the Stepford Connect map (Regional 1). Class 444 now shares the route with the Class 68 . Getting to Stepford Central is quicker on foot than by train. It takes 1.5 minutes on foot and a minimum of 2 minutes by train (this is worsened by the Beechley Triangle often being congested). Prior to V1.10.4, this station lacked ticket machines despite being a large station. Inside the station facade are a row of inaccessible doors, which some believed led to signalling offices like at other stations such as Stepford Central . The platforms 5 and 6 of this station are wider, the cause is unknown. This station was originally made by former manager AMAViation, who has since left. Prior to British Railway's (Roblox) 1.1.0 update, one of the station signs on Victoria Harbour (Platform 1) read "Stepford Victoria". This was a reference to this station. [ note 1 ] The sign was removed after the update. Notes [ ] ↑ British Railway Wiki : Victoria Harbour (Trivia) "Prior to 1.1.0, one of the station signs on Platform 1 read "Stepford Victoria".

Couldn't really do up this line without giving the people of this village their rail service back, could I... 🤔 29 October - Version 1.7 Upper Staploe added to the network, located between Hampton Hargate and Water Newton , as a limited-service Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms. New route: R039 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Added Stepford Connect services to Stepford Central , St Helens Bridge , Leighton West and Westwyvern . New routes: R003 , R025 & R044 Route change: R039 ( Benton <> Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City ) Now terminates at Leighton City. 2022 27 February - Version 1.8.2 Added Stepford Connect services to the Stepford Victoria branch . New route: R045 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 CIS Boards and benches added. 2025 5 August - Version 2.2.1 A poster named "Enjoy Metro" was added near the station. This won the first Community Spotlight hosted in May 2025. Enjoy Metro' by Yengamertv Trivia [ ] This station has step-free access. This station was sneak peeked by Charlie_RBX on 27 September 2020. Upper Staploe's sneak peek It was not known that the slow tracks slightly diverge off the mainline to serve this station. The fast tracks are around 250 metres from here. Before V1.8 , R039 was the only route that stopped here, which once made it the least served on the Stepford Connect network. This station used to be the only one that did not have any CIS Boards and benches until V2.0 . Before V1.8 , this station was one of the two only stations served by Stepford Connect which do not have a route calling at Stepford Central , along with Millcastle Racecourse . It was also the only station on the entire Stepford Connect network at that time for not having a train going to any stations in Stepford City without interchange . After the aforementioned update, the addition of R003 and R025 calling at this station provides direct services to the Stepford City Centre from here, with the trait transferred to Leighton West . The announcements for Platform 1 are known to play too early before the train arrives. This is likely due to the placement of the sensor much further away from the station. The same occurs for Platform 1 at New Harrow . The chat filter censors Upper Staploe to "##### #taploe", likely because the Roblox chat filter interpreting it as an attempt to say the word "Uppers", a slang term for a type of illegal drug. There is a road connecting Farleigh to this station, this also means Upper Staploe is quite near the Stepford Airport . If one walked from this station to Farleigh , it would be faster than taking a train. Before Farleigh was added in V1.10 , this road used to lead out of Upper Staploe before floating above the baseplate without supports and then abruptly stopping in the middle of nowhere. The Staploe Tap Just outside the station, there is a Commercial Building named "The Staploe Tap", which is likely to be a pub.

This station is one of two abandoned stations in the game that are still intact currently, with the other being Robinson Way , an abandoned Tramlink station. Before V1.7 , the platforms were arranged in a way that each of the two platforms were served by a different operator. The platform towards Llyn-by-the-Sea was located on the Stepford Connect tracks, while the platform towards Stepford City was (and still is) located on the AirLink / Stepford Express tracks. This is the only planned Metro station that is just left abandoned in game, as Coxly Newtown was reopened in V2.2 . Diagram of the track layout This station still remains in the game as of V2.2 , with the AirLink / Stepford Express tracks passing through. The station along with the area around it was redesigned in V2.0 , extending the village and adding overgrown tracks on the Leighton -bound platform. This made it so that the station is accessible from the Stepford Connect Upper Staploe station to here without trespassing . Going past the wooden barriers is still considered trespassing.

There's always more to see... 🗑️🚆 12 August - Version 2.0 Station upgraded, with footbridge access to Platform 3 and 4, and addition of lifts. New route: R057 Water Newton is now dispatchable. 12 September - Version 2.0.1 Class 80x stop marker added to Platform 3. Trivia [ ] The station is based on Pitsea station in Essex. Before V2.0 , the station was not step-free due to its lack of lifts or accessible ramps. It was also the last station in the game to not have step free access of any kind. Water Newton is one of 10 stations that got an upgrade in V1.7 . [ 1 ] Prior to this upgrade, a section of track near this station had a terminating junction. Prior to The Big Update , this station had no entrance and was very under-detailed. Despite considerable investment in enhancing it, the station still remains uninterested in by passengers and drivers alike. In The Big Update , one of the two island platforms was demolished, with the singular remaining one still being used. Despite this station being called "Water Newton", there are no bodies of water near this station. It is possible to walk to Rosedale Village from here via road without trespassing within a few minutes. The AWS ramp in question Oddly, there was a random AWS ramp hidden in the bushes near Platform 1, although it has since been removed. Prior to V2.0 , players could not access Platform 4 from the rest of the station, unless the player trespassed or walked from the road behind. In V2.0 , a new special sign was added at the entrance, displaying "Welcome to Water Newton", unlike the regular station sign, which simply shows the station name. This is the only Stepford Connect managed station that is served by AirLink .

New concourse and platform facelift. Adverts added next to Platform 1. Scenery near the station upgraded, with a marketplace near the station as the spawn point. Stepford Express services can now pass this station. 27 August - Version 1.10 Added Waterline services to Airport Terminal 2 and the Esterfield branch . Route change: R014 ( Newry <> James Street → Esterfield ) Now terminates at Esterfield. New routes: R017 & R018 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 New route: R120 Trivia [ ] This is former Product Developer Mattyx2013 's favourite station. He is also fond of Starryloch . The station loosely resembles Heaton station in Newcastle. They have a similar layout and similar features. However, the modern features make West Benton also similar to Pelaw metro station along the Tyne and Wear metro line. This is one of the greatest places for trainspotting, as Stepford Connect and Stepford Express trains can often be seen passing right next to this station. Some inexperienced drivers tend to skip West Benton as they drive faster than the speed limit and do not realise how close West Benton is to Faraday Road and Benton . It is speculated that West Benton Skips Co , a commercial building in Westercoast , is a reference to this fact. Before V1.1.7, West Benton was not a dispatchable station. When it was made one, however, former Product Developer Mattyx2013 was reportedly dispatching there the moment the change was made. West Benton Pet Supplies, a commercial building , is located just around the curve from this station. Strangely, the V1.9.1 upgrade added another "Supplies" to the building signage. It is unknown whether this was made on purpose. A viewing deck has been added beside the station entrance in V1.4.1 . This station has step-free access. The speed limit between here to Benton was 75 MPH. It was changed to 45 MPH to Benton in V1.4.1 and from Benton in V1.6 , and reverted back to 75 MPH from Benton in V1.7 . The speed limit through this station going to Benton is 50 MPH as of V1.9 . West Benton is one of the few stations where players are allowed to speed up when approaching it, as the speed limit raises from 30 to 75 MPH shortly before the station, from Benton . This station's name is censored in game chat for no apparent reason. The players name West Benton in a fun way: Best Wenton. This happens to Beaulieu Park , Coxly , Whitney Green , Connolly and Upper Staploe , too. Beechley is also censored, but it has a clearer explanation. Players can walk from here to Benton , Coxly and Faraday Road without trespassing . The stop marker for Platform 1 was hidden behind a wall and could not be seen from outside. This is due to the straightening of the wall adjacent to the station. Prior to V1.7 , this wall had a slight inclination with the marker peeking from the side. This has been pointed out by many including on the Discord #screenshots channel. The stop marker has now been moved onto the platform in V1.7.2. With the station upgrade in V1.9.1, a model of the Class 165/0 was added on a exhibition stand, that labels the following text in the top right corner of the stand "This is one of the old models of the old NGv2 trains created by Mattyx2013 (statue outside)" Prior to Version 2.0 , " models " was misspelt as " modals ". This station, along with Ashlan Park 's upgrade was not sneak peeked before V1.9.1's release. There is a graffiti outside the small park behind Mattyx2013 's statue that says " Matty wuz also 'Ere ", similar in style to the one seen at Whitefield . According to Mattyx2013 , there were two initial overhaul versions of the station for V1.9.1, with the final design merging features from the two. [ 1 ] The first version was reminiscent of the former model of the station, albeit with some changes. However the file for the station inadvertently vanished. The second version was based off a park-like metro station, however this received disapproval from former (then-incumbent) Managing Director Charlie_RBX . West Benton is notable for being in the middle of Faraday Road TMD and Benton Siding , with both spawn points facing away from the station. This makes it difficult to reach the station easily from a depot , with Esterfield Mainline Depot being the only one to do so.

We understand you are a bit disappointed with the delay - we didn't make this choice lightly. The ROBLOX outage did also coincide with a time we planned to get loads done so that was annoying timing... Remember, we have only pushed it back a few weeks - it is still not far off! We are working really hard to get it to you, and we want to prove that to you! So, here is the first sneak peek of what we have been working on. About halfway down the Llyn line, with scenery done by the surprisingly talented @[PDV] Thehazad9 We hope you like it - I am really excited about this extension, and Harry has done lots of the scenery to make the towns more immersive to walk around ! #Express #ConnectExtension #ComingSoon 17 December - Version 1.4 Westercoast added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms; Stepford Express passes and does not stop. New routes: R024 , R025 & R026 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New routes: R035 , R036 ( Class 68 only), R037 & R038 20 August - Version 1.6.5 Dispatcher trainings are no longer held here. 2021 19 February - Version 1.7.2 New route: R040 3 September Sneak peek for Westercoast's overhaul was released. Yet another station upgrade, coming to v1.8! 👀 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled with a new building and entrance at Platform 1. Added Stepford Connect services to Leighton West . Route changes: R037 ( Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City <> Llyn-by-the-Sea ) R038 ( Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City <> Westwyvern ) Now terminate at Leighton City. New route: R042 2022 24 April Sneak peek for a new footbridge at Westercoast was released. Not just a train update in this one... Squealing into an SCR version 1.8.4 near you very soon! Coming very soon! 25 April - Version 1.8.4 New footbridge added between platforms. Added a new spawn location: Station Forecourt 15 May - Version 1.9 Class 43 stop markers added to Platform 1. Added limited Stepford Express services to the Newry Branch and Llyn-by-the-Sea . New route: R083 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platforms 1 & 2. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay Branch . New routes: R050 & R102 24 December - Version 2.1 New route: R088 Trivia [ ] The section of track near this station is similar to a real life station on the East Coast Mainline named Welwyn North . (From London/Stepford). Similarities include the 4 track sections from both sides narrowing to 2 tracks, approaching the station. The viaduct and subsequent tunnel is also done in a similar fashion to in real life. This station and its scenery were built by Product Developer thehazad9. Dispatcher trainings used to take place here from V1.5 to V1.6.5; the previous location was at Stepford United Football Club , along with Faymere . They moved back to Stepford United Football Club in V1.6.5, then moved to Willowfield for a while in V1.7.4, and subsequently back to Stepford United Football Club again in V1.8 . Although this station is dispatchable, it is very rare to see a dispatcher here as it is rare to see Stepford Connect trains venture past Leighton City (as it is a terminus for the free route R045 ). The line that this station is situated on is served by Stepford Express services, however none of them stopped here until R083 was introduced in V1.9. This station is considered to have some of the best scenery in the game, with more Commercial Buildings than any other station lining the town's streets. There are more Commercial Buildings containing the word " Bodin " (4) in this stations' scenery than "Westercoast" (2). The largest viaduct in Stepford County is found at Westercoast ( Westercoast Viaduct ). The part of the viaduct in the town has “Westercoast” written in golden letters on its side. Westercoast was the first station on the Llyn extension to be officially sneak-peeked. This station, as well as Morganstown and Willowfield , are the longest single-word station names, with the overall longest station name being Stepford United Football Club . This station, along with Whitefield , had large "Welcome to (Station Name)" signs outside prior to Version 1.6 . They were replaced with plain platform signs. This station is still quite unique with its "Services To: Llyn-By-The-Sea" and "Services To: Stepford/Leighton" signs at the entrances to both platforms. The plain platform signs was removed in V1.8 . Prior to V1.8.4, there was only a foot crossing between the platforms. It is sometimes hard to get to Platform 1 because Westercoast only has two spawns on the westbound side and the crossing sometimes despawns you as the tracks here are more leveled up than other foot crossings in SCR. As of V1.8.4, this can be circumvented by using the footbridge. When arriving this station from Faymere , the driver would always be 1–2 minutes early unless the train was already delayed before reaching Faymere , as the timing between the stations was set too high. This can cause SPADs for fast Stepford Express trains which do not stop at this station. Additionally, Stepford Express trains can also be delayed if they are being held up by a Stepford Connect train at this station. This station received a minor upgrade in V1.8 , adding a concourse and small buildings on both sides, however it was not mentioned in the official patch notes. This was likely accidental. This station has the National Rail Double Arrow symbol on the east entrance station sign. It can also be found at Stepford Airport Central , Rosedale Village and Northshore . On 24 April 2022, a sneak peek showing the addition of a footbridge to the station was revealed, being released into V1.8.4 the next day. The footbridge received criticism quickly, with players stating that it does not fit the station, as well as being unnecessary. Oddly, despite having a Llyn via Benton Stepford Express route ( R088 ) stopping here, the Stepford Express map does not include this station on said line.

History [ ] 2019 17 December - Version 1.4 Westwyvern added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a major through station with 5 platforms, serving Stepford Connect and Stepford Express . Some services terminate early here at Platform 4. New routes: R024 , R025 , R026 , R077 & R078 2020 22 February - Version 1.4.1 Westwyvern is now managed by Stepford Express instead of Stepford Connect . Station upgraded with a rebuilt entrance, with the seating area removed. 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New routes: R035 , R036 , R037 & R038 29 October - Version 1.7 New routes: R080 & R082 2021 19 February - Version 1.7.2 Class 43 stop markers added to Platforms 2 & 3. New route: R040 5 December - Version 1.8 Added Stepford Connect services to Leighton West . Route changes: R037 ( Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City <> Llyn-by-the-Sea ) R038 ( Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City <> Westwyvern ) Now terminates at Leighton City. New route: R042 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platforms 2 & 3. 2024 11 February Sneak peek for Westwyvern's overhaul released. Another day, another refurbished station 🌇 12 August - Version 2.0 Station overhauled, now resembles more of Grantham station . A lounge and a station office has been added, located at Platform 1 and between Platform 2 & 4 respectively. Platforms decreased from 5 to 4. Platform 1 now also serves westbound Stepford Express services in addition to Stepford Connect . Platform 2 is now exclusive to eastbound Stepford Express services. Platform 3 is now the terminating platform. However, Platform 4 can still allow for terminating services. Platform 4 now serves as the eastbound platform for both Stepford Connect and Stepford Express . Added Stepford Connect & Stepford Express services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New routes: R050 , R102 & R087 Trivia [ ] Westwyvern is based on Grantham station in Lincolnshire. This station, along with Millcastle , were the two stations on the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension that were not revealed on the SCR Official Discord server before opening. This is the first station to be managed by Stepford Express , with Leighton Stepford Road and Northshore following. All 3 stations were formerly managed by Stepford Connect . Strangely, the sign outside the station still showed Stepford Connect under the National Rail logo until V1.6 . From V1.4.1 to V1.6.5, although this station was managed by Stepford Express , dispatchers at this station were given the generic uniform (i.e. the uniform worn by dispatchers at stations managed by Network Rail ) despite the station not being operated by Network Rail . This was due to Stepford Express not having its own dispatching uniform at the time. This was eventually changed with the new uniforms in V1.7 . In V1.4.1 : The station signs on the platforms changed from Stepford Connect to Stepford Express , making Westwyvern the first station on the Network with Stepford Express station signs. Additionally, the entrance of this station was rebuilt and the seating area at the entrance has been removed. You could walk through the walls of the footbridge at this station, which was likely caused by developers forgetting to enable collision in Studio. This gets frustrating for players because they might fall onto the tracks and respawn. This was fixed in V1.7 . However, the walls of the elevators of the footbridge are still non-collidable. The approach ramp into the station was non-collidable, meaning it was possible to fall out of the ramp leading up to the footbridge into the station. When Faymere Green TMD was released, trains could now spawn there to Westwyvern instead of spawning all the way over at the now defunct Coxly Depot . Prior to V2.0 : This station had the least amount of scenery in the entire Llyn extension before its overhaul. There was a flyover to allow terminating trains to reach Platform 4. However, Stepford Connect trains headed to this station from Millcastle had a chance to be SPADed by Stepford Express trains on R082 ( Stepford Central <> Westwvyern ) as there was a crossover track for Stepford Express trains to go on the flyover, though this was quite rare as the Llyn Branch has less trains than the Stepford City or the Leighton Zone . As of V2.0 , this is still possible despite the switch to a tunnel. There is a very short platform on the opposite side of Platform 3, next to Platform 4. However, trains do not open their doors there because the platform is too short for most trains. In V1.7 , Stepford Express services can now terminate with R082 . This was the only station which provided cross-platform interchange between Stepford Connect and Stepford Express in both directions for trains travelling in the same direction. With the platform changes in V2.0 , this only applies to eastbound services. Passengers can, however, do a same-platform interchange at Platform 1. R081 , R083 , R085 and R088 skips this station despite it being owned by Stepford Express , making them the only routes in SCR able to skip this station. Routes that terminate at this station generally have poor timetables, causing on-time Drivers to have to wait multiple minutes at the terminating platform before being able to turn around or despawn. This station is the only station that has a station office, the interior consisting of two desks with computers and a CIS Board . Oddly, the sign at the office uses the old SCR logo. This is only available to players in the Dispatcher role or higher. The station office sign There is a church with a graveyard near the station that contains the tombstones of the removed Class 465 , Class 508 , Class 700 and Class 701 .

History [ ] 2019 28 April - Version 1.2 Whitefield added to the network as part of the Whitefield extension as a Stepford Connect terminus. Based on Bradford Forster Square station. Only has a simple station building with no entrance. New routes: R020 & R022 17 December - Version 1.4 Station headcode: W → F W was taken by Westwyvern . 2020 3 January Sneak peek for Whitefield's overhaul was released. Happy New Year from the SCR Team! We've been quiet since releasing V1.4 but I have been hard at work for you all! Coming soon to SCR: The Long awaited NG Class 465, NG Class 331 and a scenery upgrade for Whitefield, as well as a few other bits and bobs! 😄 22 February - Version 1.4.1 Station overhauled. Now has an entrance from a road outside. Platforms remain the same, but with Stepford Connect blue instead of Metro red. 2021 21 November Sneak peek for Whitefield's second overhaul was released. As has become a bit of a tradition... it is sneak peek Sunday! Here is another area and station upgrade, courtesy of @[SG] Mattyx2013. We hope you love it as much as we do! Coming soon to v1.8 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled. New station building and concourse with shops. Now based on Eastbourne station . Added a new spawn location Side Entrance . Island platform moved from Platform 1 & 2 to Platform 2 & 3. Added OHLE. Platform allocation is now randomised. Route change: R022 ( Stepford Victoria → Beechley <> Whitefield ) Now terminates at Beechley. No longer stops at Stepford Victoria , Financial Quarter , City Hospital , Whitefield Lido & Houghton Rake . 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Platforms lowered to fix a issue with Mark 3 Coaches clipping through the platforms. Though this brought another issue where all station props (except benches) have disappeared. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 OHLE removed. Station props have been readded. New route: R103 Trivia [ ] When V1.2 released, Whitefield released with its original design from SCR Legacy , which was low quality, making it unappealing. The only recognisable differences were the implementations of CIS Boards and Concourse Information Boards , and the Stepford Connect signs. This station also lacked scenery compared to other stations on the branch, and on the network as a whole. It had no roads or paths, no buildings or scenery, and even lacked an entrance. The station received an entrance in this facelift. The station pillars were changed from " Metro red " to " Stepford Connect turquoise ." This station had a large "Welcome to Whitefield" sign outside, originally in Connect branding. A similar sign was also in place at Westercoast and Millcastle Racecourse . They were replaced by plain signs, and were eventually removed. Before the station was re-upgraded in V1.8 , many players stated that Whitefield looked similar to Connolly , a Waterline station. This is because of the platform arrangement and station design: Both stations had three platforms and were at the end of their respective branches. Both stations had a vintage-like brick colour. Both stations have platform canopies. Both stations have a train stabled there. Even though the station Whitefield Lido has the term "Whitefield" in its name, it is closer to Stepford Central than it is to Whitefield. This station is 3 stations apart from Whitefield Lido . This station has step-free access as the platforms are on ground level. Players can walk from here to Willowfield without trespassing or without going via another station. This station was well known for the boarded-up Metro commercial building adjacent to the station (this indicated that Metro was cancelled). However, in V1.8 , this was demolished with the second Whitefield upgrade. Before V1.8 , the station was sneak peeked with route indicators ; they did not come with V1.8 though. A preview with tracks curving to a terminating station, surrounded by scenery as well as a train wash on one of the tracks, was released on 22 November 2021, in the SCR Official Discord. This was eventually confirmed to be Whitefield on V1.8 's release. When players leave this station on a train, there is graffiti on the bridge that says " Matty Wuz 'Ere ": a nod to the fact that former Product Developer Mattyx2013 designed this station. The branch this station is located on ( Whitefield Branch ), along with the Leighton West Branch and the Rayleigh Bay Branch , are the only Stepford Connect branches to have no services to St Helens Bridge . This station is one of three stations to have a stabled train directly in it, the others being Connolly and Esterfield . This is the only station to have a stabled train that is not on Waterline . Between V2.0 and V2.2 , all of the light posts and station signs were accidentally removed while lowering the platforms to fix a clipping issue. A floating departure board on Platform 1 was fixed in V2.1 . Electric trains could previously serve this station until Version 2.2 , where the overhead line equipment was removed, only allowing diesel trains beyond Stepford UFC . Despite Whitefield still being a Stepford Connect station, Dispatchers now spawn with Metro uniforms.

This is my first submission to the SCR Dev Team!! Everyone say hello to <top secret>. Coming soon to a SCR near you 😉 28 April - Version 1.2 Whitefield Lido added to the network as part of the Whitefield extension , as a Stepford Connect through station with 3 platforms, with Platform 3 allowing for ECS trains from Whitefield Lido Siding . New routes: R020 , R021 , R022 & R023 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield Branch . New route: R031 2021 13 November Sneak peek for Whitefield Lido's overhaul was released. Sorry it has been a bit quiet on the sneak peek front! Unfortunately a lot of the team have been ill or away, but we've been continuing to work behind the scenes! So, here's yet another station refurb coming to you in v1.8, very soon! 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled. The station is now elevated. Now based on Wallasey Village station . Added OHLE and platform layout changed to side platforms. Scenery upgrade including a pool next to the station. Platform 3 removed along with Whitefield Lido Siding . Route removal: R022 No longer stops here. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Whitefield Lido is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. Route removal: R020 No longer stops here. 5 August - Version 2.2 A poster named "A new chapter" was added next to the ticket machines. This won the first Community Spotlight hosted in May 2025. 'A new chapter' by martoto008 Trivia [ ] According to Mattyx2013, this station is based on the real life Wallasey Village station in Merseyside. There was formerly an advertisement on the billboard for West Benton Pet Supplies, which is located opposite West Benton station. This ad can now only be seen at Starryloch and Whitefield . Ironically, there is no West Benton Pet Supplies advertisement at West Benton station. This may be because it can be seen from the station. Despite this station being called "Whitefield Lido" (the word "lido" means a swimming pool or a beach), prior to Version 1.8 , there was no lido or body of water. There were only trees and a road near the entrance. The closest body of water would be the little water basin just underneath the approach to St Helens Bridge . Even though this station has the term "Whitefield" in its name, it is closer to Stepford Central than it is to Whitefield . This station is 3 stations apart, with a 3.11 mile (or 5.01 kilometres) distance from Whitefield . After V2.2 , there are no direct routes from here to Whitefield . There was once a pair of unused Tramlink platforms located under this station, but they were demolished when the station was released. Walking to Stepford United Football Club is possible by using the road running alongside the railway. Before Version 1.8 , trains exiting Whitefield Lido Siding would arrive on Platform 3. If Platform 2 was occupied, trains on the mainline could also use a crossover track to get to Platform 3, but this rarely happened as the Whitefield Branch was rarely busy. The siding was demolished in V1.8 , as well as the removal of Platform 3. For a while, the line was lifted north of here. This was likely because most of the stations were completely remodelled. Whitefield and Stepford High Street were the only stations that were not rebuilt. Stepford High Street was later rebuilt in V1.6 , but Whitefield and Whitefield Lido have remained basically the same. When the Whitefield Lido overhaul sneak peek for V1.8 showed only 2 platforms at the station, some feared that Whitefield Lido Siding would be demolished as part of the upgrade, which was confirmed when the update released. This station, along with Woodhead Lane and Faraday Road , are the few stations to have non-concrete platform bases. According to Mattyx2013 , he designed a new station model intended for Whitefield Lido at first, but the model was then changed to be used at James Street instead. [ 1 ] Eventually, the model was never used at either station. There is a rusty station sign that is near the entrance of the station, symbolising the former Stepford Connect operations. Oddly, when spawning here as a Dispatcher , the Stepford Connect uniform is given instead of a Metro one. Even stranger is that a Dispatcher will spawn with Metro uniform at Whitefield . This is likely to be a developer oversight. References [ ] ↑ Actual SCR Secrets (I Promise!) (29 September 2022). Mattyx2013 on YouTube.

Added OHLE for both Waterline and Tramlink . 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Lift access added, the station is now step-free. Class 730/0 stop markers added added to Platform 1 & 2. Announcement change: The Waterline announcement is now: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:WGW.ogg instead of: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:WGC.ogg 2025 5 November Sneak peek for Whitney Green's upgrade was released. A green light has been given to a slightly red makeover. 🟢🔵🔴 Coming to SCR version 2.3 Trivia [ ] Whitney Green has remained almost the exact same since it was first opened before V1.0 . The only changes have been the addition of lifts and new scenery. As such, it is currently the oldest station in-game, in terms of when it was last updated, having never received any major upgrade. When Version 2.3 releases, this will no longer be the case. This station has the shortest platforms in the whole SCR network. This station and Morganstown Docks , are the only stations on the SCR network where the platforms are only long enough for 3 coaches (with the exception of the double Class 143 ). When a 4-car train approaches this station, the onboard announcement will state that the doors in the rear coach will not open. When driving a 3-car Class 195 , the driver will be prompted to move forward when the driver stopped at the S Car Marker perfectly. This also applies to Morganstown Docks. Players can walk to Beaulieu Park on Metro from this station, which means that these two stations are out of station interchanges between Metro and Waterline and is one of the three out of station interchanges in SCR. The other two are between Airport West and Stepford Airport Parkway , as well as between Coxly and Coxly Newtown . Strangely, the Tramlink tracks have been electrified along with Waterline in V1.4.1 . This is a reason why numerous users believe Tramlink is coming back. However, in V1.7.0 , the tracks here have been covered by a mesh, like in Port Benton . This did not apply to Robinson Way and Greenslade . Tramlink tracks here have also had some grass/weeds placed on them in Version 1.7 , possibly to signify that Tramlink is long gone and will not return. The grass on the Tramlink tracks Oddly, in V1.8 , the grass on the tracks were removed, causing confusion. Oddly, the stairs at the station entrance next to the ramp are floating as the stair does not touch the ground. The lifts walls at this station do not fully line up as well. This station is believed to be named after BanTech's real name, Adam Whitney, shown in the registration information of his company website . This station's name used to be censored in game chat. In order to get around this, players called Whitney Green by its acronym: WG , or bypassed the filter by typing Whit ney Green . Some users believe that the Roblox chat filter censors Whitney Green because the phrase "ney green" may be mistakenly identified as containing a racial slur.

Depot → WIL P1, then P2, then P3 Mainline → WIL P3, then P2, then P1 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Willowfield is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect . New routes: R103 & R133 Trivia [ ] This is the westernmost station in SCR. The name "Willowfield" was the original name for Financial Quarter in Metro 's original network plans. Before V1.0 , Willowfield only existed on a map. There was no station model. Unlike Beechley and City Hospital , which were only separated by around 600 metres, Willowfield is nowhere near Financial Quarter , as it is around 6 kilometres away. This station and Hemdon Park were not previewed before the release of the Willowfield Branch . Before V1.6.1, trains were able to drive through the buffers as they were non-collidable. However, this was patched the following day. The longest route on any operator starts here, being R036 ( Willowfield <> Llyn-by-the-Sea ). This route is exclusive to the Class 68 and Class 444 . This station, Morganstown , and Westercoast have the longest single-word station names. The longest overall is Stepford United Football Club . Willowfield Depot is just south of this station. Only trains from the station depot will arrive at Willowfield, and trains from the mainline depot directly go to Hemdon Park or Beechley . Players can walk from here to Whitefield without trespassing or without going via any other station. This is one of two stations where its depot leads straight to the station, with all routes terminating there. The other station with this trait is Esterfield . Edgemead Siding used to have this trait, until it was removed as part of the Edgemead upgrade in V1.7.2. Dispatcher trainings were held here from V1.7.4. Previously, they were held at Stepford United Football Club . Trainings were later moved back to Stepford United Football Club in V1.8 , before being moved to a separate training map. This station only has one bench and one waiting house on its platforms, making it the station with the lowest amount of benches. Oddly, players can walk on the track beds behind the buffers without being despawned.

It was served by Connect services to Stepford Town . This station is infamous for being the only demolished station in the history of the entire network. Prior to The Big Update, it garnered a wave of sympathy, with staff even organising farewell events. It is speculated that Winstree was removed as former SCR Developer Jadey_SR requested its removal after Managing Director Charlie_RBX shared plans of continuing SCR for profit. Around the same time, former SCR Developer vOranges uncopylocked the game, which was another contributory factor, and it resulted in the release of multiple unofficial 'SCR Legacy' games. Just before the removal, many players gathered around the station, organising farewell events to say goodbye to Winstree for good. The site of the station now is the BanTech Systems building, opposite Rocket Parade .

This station was designed based on Colchester , a station on the Greater Anglia network in Essex, UK. Notes [ ] ↑ Prior to Winstree's removal, the tracks beyond the station ran to Winstree Depot and an unopened station called "Leighton" (which is widely believed to be an old version of the station now known as Leighton City ). However, there were no services that went there, making it inaccessible by all means except through trespassing . Gallery [ ] The HS (HighSpeed) signs at Winstree.

Build number 4 and I think that I can safely say that this is the most scenic station so far 😁 28 April - Version 1.2 Woodhead Lane added to the network as part of the Whitefield extension , as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms. Resembles Southease station . A brown footbridge in the station connects the platforms. New routes: R020 & R022 2021 11 September Sneak peek for Woodhead Lane's overhaul was released. 🌇 Thanks to some help from ex-developer, @[SG] Mattyx2013 , who's done some one-off work for us - here's an area that needed some love, but where is it? 🤔 Also here's the first one of many upgraded scenery features on trial here thanks to @[PDV] MrTransportGuy - what do we all think?! Coming to an v1.8 near you! 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled. No longer resembles Southease station . Platform layout changed from side platforms to staggered platforms, footbridge removed. Added OHLE and Stop Markers for the Class 720 and Class 730/1 . Route change: R022 ( Stepford Victoria → Beechley <> Whitefield ) Now terminates at Beechley. No longer stops: Stepford Victoria , Financial Quarter , City Hospital , Whitefield Lido & Houghton Rake 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Platforms have been lowered and extended slightly to fit certain trains better. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 OHLE removed. New route: R103 Trivia [ ] This station formerly resembled Southease station in real life prior to its overhaul. The rail crossing , as with the other gates in-game (notably Houghton Rake and Westercoast ), are not functional. They are set to the "down" position, even if no trains are scheduled. This station has step-free access. Fully working rail crossings can be found on the former SCR roadmap, but they are not in earnest priority according to former Managing Director Charlie_RBX . During a developer Q&A on 23 October 2021, he stated, "[they] will not come in the short term as [they are] not on the top of the priority list." It is also unknown if signals for pedestrians and road traffic will be implemented. The original station was revealed on 16 March 2019, by former Product Developer Mattyx2013 . This station is within walking distance of Stepford United Football Club and Whitefield Lido . "Woodhead" is the surname of the former Managing Director Charlie_RBX in real life. In a Q&A, it was revealed that the station was named after him. This is the only in-game reference to former Managing Director Charlie_RBX after the controversy in 2022. This station, as well as Whitefield Lido , are the only stations to have poles holding the platforms up instead of traditional concrete blocks. All stations had this feature introduced after their upgrades. This station and Aslockby are the only stations to feature staggered side platforms. Between V1.8 and V1.9.1, Ashlan Park also shared this trait, until staggered platforms were removed when the station received an upgrade in V1.9.1. If the player walks to the end of the road, they can travel under the station. Under the baseplate, there used to be an old bridge that used to stretch towards Houghton Rake . This is technically a glitch, as this is not supposed to happen. Therefore, this can also be considered trespassing . This bridge was in use up until V1.8 , where the alignment of the Whitefield Branch changed to feature more curves, bringing it to the standards of SCR's more recent output. Woodhead Lane was one of the stations used to train Dispatchers between its original release and Version 1.4 , when trainings were moved to the vicinity of Faymere . Trainings returned to the station shortly after Version 1.6.5 released, continuing until a new map was created for training. The platforms at this station are not long enough for trains with 5 cars or more. There are special purple stop markers for the Class 720 and 730 here to allow them to fit better on the platforms. These special stop markers were removed in Version 2.2 due to the line beyond Stepford UFC becoming diesel only. Now, the only train that doesn't fully fit is the Class 68 where the rear locomotive car does not fit on the platform. Oddly enough, this station has no ticket machines.
