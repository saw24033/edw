Airport West station is not a part of this branch. The Airport Branch has long existed even before The Big Update . At the time, the branch only consisted of Stepford Airport Parkway and Stepford Airport Central . With the release of Version 1.1 , a new operator, AirLink , was founded. This operator extends the branch to Airport Terminal 1 and Airport Terminal 2 . At the same time, Stepford Airport Parkway Siding and Stepford Airport Parkway TMD was also built exclusively for AirLink trains. On 2 February 2019, the branch was further extended with the opening of Airport Terminal 3 . This became the final extension of the branch to this day. In V1.10 , Waterline was extended from Airport West to Airport Terminal 2 , using part of the branch. In the aforementioned update, Stepford Connect had some routes extended to Airport Terminal 2 via Stepford Airport Central.

The community speculates that in Version 2.3 , the tunnel stub from Barton may be used. This is due to Metro serving Whitney Green as shown in a Sneak Peek posted on 5 November 2025.

Results (as of 31 May 2021): 2096 votes for Leighton West extension, 5575 votes for Waterline extension. 22 August Sneak peek for Leighton West released, leading to speculation that the Waterline extension was cancelled. 23 October During a Developer Q&A, it was confirmed that both the Leighton West and Waterline extensions would be built. Leighton West included in Version 1.8 . Waterline extension would follow as part of a future Airport Zone overhaul. 2022 7 August Sneak peek of Farleigh released, sparking speculation about multiple stations in the upcoming extension. This was later confirmed via a video on BanTech's YouTube channel. 27 August - Version 1.10 Waterline extension released as part of a major Airport Zone upgrade. Branch renamed from James Street Branch to Esterfield Branch . Three new stations added: Farleigh , Rosedale Village , and Esterfield . Sneak peeks [ ] Speculated sneak peek [ ] The sneak peek in question On 18 April 2022, a sneak peek was released of an unknown Waterline station. Many players suspected that the station shown is the station past James Street , as it appeared to be in an area not seen before in SCR. However this was seen as impossible, as the station shown is not a terminating station. Some players have assumed that it was a refreshed James Street , while others thought that it was an upgraded Ashlan Park . However, when V1.9 was released, the sneak peek turned out to show Eden Quay . Sneak peeks for Version 1.10 [ ] Before the release of V1.10 , a few sneak peeks were speculated to show the extension. Sneak peek on 12 June 2022 [ ] The sneak peek of Airport West On 12 June 2022, SCR released a sneak peek of an unknown Waterline station. Many people presume that this station is Airport West or James Street . A week later, a sneak peek of Airport Terminal 1 was released. These sneak peeks, along with the statement given in the Q&A on 23 October 2021, has led to speculations that the Waterline extension may come in the near future. The station ultimately turned out to be Airport West . Sneak peek on 24 July 2022 [ ] Sneak peek of the then-unknown Esterfield , the terminus of the extension. On 24 July 2022, another sneak peek was released featuring another unknown Waterline station. The caption - \"Bringing you the worst, best kept secret in the whole of Stepford county...\" - made players speculate that this is the terminus of the extension, as it has been delayed multiple times and has been a mark throughout SCR's history. The station eventually became known as Esterfield . Sneak peek on 7 August 2022 [ ] The sneak peek of Farleigh station On 7 August 2022, a sneak peek of the new Farleigh station on Waterline was revealed, many players speculated this station along with the sneak peek above will be part of the Waterline Extension, and that the extension will include two or more stations instead of one. Update trailer on 27 August 2022 [ ] On 27 August, a video released on BanTech's YouTube channel showcased Version 1.10 . In one frame of the video, a Waterline PIS is seen displaying \"t, Farleigh , Rose...\", and with the train's destination being \" Esterfield \", hinting that there are at least three stations beyond James Street , if the 'T' is for James Stree t . This theory was confirmed with the release of the update on the same day. Trivia [ ] The extension was originally planned to have multiple stations past James Street , before being cut down to just one station due to the size of the Willowfield extension. However, the sneak peeks of Esterfield and Farleigh , published on 24 July 2022 and 7 August 2022 respectively, prompted speculations in the community that the extension would once again have more than one station. These speculations were eventually confirmed with the release of V1.10 on 27 August 2022.

This branch is one of the only branches in the network to not have OHLE, and therefore can only be driven on by diesel trains. The signals for this branch all start with the letter \"R\". There are no limited service stops on this branch. This branch, along with the Leighton West Branch and the Airport Branch , are the only branches to contain single-platform stations. The branch merges into a single track near Carnalea Bridge . To enter the branch from the Stepford Main Line , services must travel via Platform 1 at Edgemead . Stepford Connect trains headed between Leighton City / Leighton West and the branch will need to switch directions there. This branch and the Leighton West Branch are the only two branches that have no connection to Stepford City. This was once the only branch on Stepford Connect that required a train to be purchased first, because the starter train, the Class 357 , cannot be driven on this branch. The minimum number of points needed to drive on this branch is 1,800 points . However, with the removal of electrification on the Whitefield Branch in Version 2.2 , it is no longer unique to this branch Example: Purchase the Class 158 (1,500 points ) and R050 (300 points ).

The branch was first proposed under Metro operations with 6 stations ( Stepford High Street , Whitefield Lido , Stepford United FC (now Stepford United Football Club , Stepford UFC, or Stepford United), Woodhead Lane , Houghton Rake and Whitefield ) without any connections to other operators . The project of Metro (in its original iteration) was soon left abandoned. It opened on 28 April 2019 .

Trains originated or terminated at either Stepford UFC or Whitefield . 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Entire branch overhauled (except Stepford High Street ) by former developer Mattyx2013 . A small Easter egg referencing his work was added near Whitefield station. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Stepford High Street moved underground into the Metro Core Section , with its former elevated platforms now abandoned. Electrification removed between Woodhead Lane TMD and Whitefield , restricting the line to diesel-only Stepford Connect trains.

Strangely, the developers decided to replace the third rail with Overhead Line Equipment for unknown reasons despite some trains (such as the Class 444 , Class 458 and Class 707 ) only being able to be powered by third rail in real life. The OHLE is now only used by Metro, as the line beyond Stepford UFC is explicitly unelectrified and limited to diesels. OHLE was removed after Woodhead Lane TMD and on the abandoned Stepford High Street platforms with Version 2.2 . References [ ] \u2191 Actual SCR Secrets (I Promise!) (29 September 2022).
