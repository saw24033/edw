History [ ] 2019 1 February - Version 1.1.9 Airport Terminal 1 added to the network as part of the Airport Terminals and is an underground AirLink through station with 1 platform. Trains cannot return from Airport Terminal 2 as it is unidirectional. New routes: R052 & R053 2022 19 June Sneak peek for Airport Terminal 1's overhaul was released. Don't feel blue, we have an upgraded station for you... 27 August - Version 1.10 Station overhauled with a new station building. Resembles Heathrow Terminal 4 station . Shops were added outside the platforms instead of a black wall at the exit. Airport Terminal 1 is no longer dispatchable. New routes: R058 & R060 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 1. Trivia [ ] The name is based on Heathrow's terminal stations, but Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3 are served by the same station. The latest station model resembles Heathrow Terminal 4 station . This is the second station to have one track and one platform. The first is Newry Harbour , the third is Leighton West and the fourth is Carnalea Bridge . This station is also one of the two stations to be through stations with single platforms, the other being Carnalea Bridge . However, Newry Harbour had another platform added in V1.9 . The CIS Boards at this station used to not function properly. Prior to V1.10, passengers wishing to go to Airport Terminal 3 or Stepford Airport Central had to change at Airport Terminal 2 , while passengers coming from Airport Terminal 3 or Airport Terminal 2 will have had to change at Stepford Airport Central in order to disembark at this station. Now, trains can travel from this station to Airport Terminal 3 directly. However, you still can not get to this station from another terminal without changing, as it is still unidirectional. Strangely, this station, which is located underground, has no entrance connecting to the ground level. Players spawning at this station would spawn directly at the concourse just before the ticket gate. This trait was formerly also shared with Airport Terminal 2 . However, when the stations in the former Airport Zone were given overhauls in V1.10 , Terminal 2 received a road connection. This station has step-free access. This station looked like Airport Terminal 2 when it was under construction. The only way to get to them would be track walking, which is considered trespassing . Trains from Leighton Stepford Road cannot call at this station. Passengers would need to disembark at Stepford Airport Central then change trains to get to this station if arriving from Leighton Stepford Road . Prior to V1.10 , this station was quite far from Airport Terminal 2 and drivers were often late when they arrived there. In addition, there was also a 75 MPH speed limit which meant drivers were often speeding in order to not be late. Compared to the distance from Stepford Airport Central to Airport Terminal 2 , the time it took from this station to Airport Terminal 2 was about 3× as long. When the overhaul sneak peek of this station was released, it received criticism for a bland design, with the blue uplights being repetitive. This station was dispatchable before V1.10 , probably due to Terminal 1 being a small station compared to other stations in Stepford Airport. Before V1.10 , there was no concourse for this station, instead there was just a wall placed there. After V1.10, a concourse was added with shops and access to departures and exits, though those end with an invisible wall with no actual access to the surface or terminal. If you manage to align your camera correctly so that you can look outside of the station, you can see that the "exits" lead into the void. At the concourse, there are 2 restaurants next to each other that seem to be in fierce competition named " Come eat pizza with us! " and " My pizza is better than yours, Billy ". This is the only station with multilingual signs, written in English, French and Spanish. This station is the only station in-game to have no access to the outside. The advertisement displayed above the station's entrance At the entrance of the station, an advert that is only displayed at this station, states "fast, direct, regular services to Stepford Central ". However, there are no direct services to Stepford Central from this station. The double variants of the Class 397 and Class 802 are too long for the platforms here, having their last 2 coaches off the platform.

History [ ] 2019 26 January Sneak peek for Airport Terminal 2 was released. 1 February - Version 1.1.9 Airport Terminal 2 added to the network as part of the Airport Terminals, as an underground AirLink terminus with 3 platforms. Based on Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 on the London Underground. Trains terminating at Platform 1 do not turn around when returning to Stepford Central . New routes: R052 & R053 2 February - Version 1.1.10 Added AirLink services to Airport Terminal 3 . New route: R055 16 September - Version 1.3.26 ( Five Million Update ) Added AirLink services to Leighton Stepford Road . New route: R057 2022 3 July Sneak peek for Airport Terminal 2's overhaul was released. Trains, planes, and another instalment for #SneakPeekSundays 27 August - Version 1.10 Station overhauled, new station building and is now located above ground. Based on Manchester Airport . Introduced "Turnaround mid-route" functionality. Platforms increased from 3 to 4; all platforms can now serve as through and terminal platforms, with the aformentioned feature. The platform allocation is randomised. The terminus loop, similar to the Port Benton Loop , was removed. Added Stepford Connect services to Stepford Victoria and Benton (via SAP ) . Added Waterline services to the Newry branch and Benton (via SAW ) . New routes: R017 , R046 , R058 , R059 & R060 2023 2 April - Version 1.10.7 New route: R048 Trivia [ ] The revamped Airport Terminal 2 is based on Manchester Airport in real life. [ 1 ] The pre- V1.10 station may have been based on Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 on the London Underground. The station's name resembles Heathrow Airport's terminal stations, however, Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, and 3 are served by the same station. This station has the most platforms among the three terminals, having 4 platforms. Prior to V1.10 , it still had the most platforms, having 3 platforms, with Airport Terminal 1 having 1 and Airport Terminal 3 having 2. This station was made dispatchable due to player demand. The CIS Boards at this station used to not function properly. This station, along with Airport Terminal 1 , used to have no exit. It was located underneath a purple airport terminal building with an ATC tower. It could be seen if you zoomed out far enough when driving a train. The building of Airport Terminal 2 and the ATC tower were also visible from James Street prior to its revamp. Before this station was opened, it had one platform, similar to Airport Terminal 1 . There are no trains to Airport Terminal 1 serving this station. In order to go to Airport Terminal 1 station from this station, passengers will need to take a train to Stepford Airport Central and then change to another train that goes via Terminal 1. This also applies to Airport Terminal 3. Airport Terminal 2 (X), as well as Farleigh (J), Esterfield (Q), Leighton West (K), and Airport Terminal 3 (Z), do not have a letter in their name that is their station headcode . Along with Airport Terminal 3 and Edgemead , this station is one of the three having the "Turnaround mid-route" functionality. This station is the second Waterline - AirLink interchange , the first being Morganstown . [ note 2 ] This station is one of the three triple-line junctions, the others being Berrily and Leighton Stepford Road . Additionally, this is the only triple-line station that is not served by Stepford Express . Despite being an airport terminal station, its scenery has little to no resemblance of an airport. It instead consists of many buildings and skyscrapers. The actual "airport terminal" is a short walk from this station. It is possible that this station additionally serves accommodation, as the "Cozy Palace Hotel" is nearby. "Cozy Palace Hotel" is likely named after " Crowne Plaza hotel ", a hotel chain that can be found near airports across the world. Between V1.10.0 and V1.10.6, this used to be the second Stepford Connect station that the Class 68 and the Class 444 couldn't serve. The first one is Houghton Rake . In V1.10.7, a new route ( R048 ( from St Helens Bridge )) was added, allowing the two trains to serve this station. This is the only station in the whole SCR network where all Aventra trains (present in the game) can go: AirLink Shuttle Class 345 , Waterline Class 730 /0, and Stepford Connect Class 720 and 730/1. The tunnel that links Farleigh TMD (Road 2) and James Street passes under this station. There is a StepAir plane roundabout between Farleigh TMD and Airport Terminal 2. The Farleigh Portal Access is located near this station, near the aforementioned StepAir plane roundabout. This is the only station serviced by Waterline that is managed by AirLink .

History [ ] 2019 2 February - Version 1.1.10 Airport Terminal 3 added to the network as part of the Airport Terminals, as an AirLink terminus with an island platform. New route: R055 16 September - Version 1.3.26 ( Five Million Update ) Added AirLink services to Leighton Stepford Road . New route: R057 2022 17 July Sneak peek for Airport Terminal 3's overhaul was released. Pillars, pillars, and yet more pillars for this instalment of #SneakPeekSundays 27 August - Version 1.10 Station overhauled, new station building and has 3 platforms (island platform with a bay platform in the middle). Based on Stansted Airport station . Introduced "Turnaround mid-route" functionality. New routes: R058 & R060 Trivia [ ] Terminal 3 is based on Stansted Airport station [ 1 ] , although its name is based on Heathrow Airport's terminal stations. However, Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 are served by the same station. The station was not on the SCR Network Map until 17 March 2019. Prior to V1.10 , unlike Airport Terminal 1 and Airport Terminal 2 where their terminal buildings were right above, the red terminal building (probably Terminal 3) was to the west of the station, which was quite far away. This station has step-free access. Passengers must go via Airport Terminal 2 and Stepford Airport Central in order to get from this station to Airport Terminal 1 , as the station only operates in a single direction. Prior to V1.10 , many players criticised this station for being bland in design, as well as it being located in a grass cutting. Many players also thought this station did not look like an airport terminal station. Airport Terminal 3 (Z), as well as Farleigh (J), Leighton West (K), Esterfield (Q) and Airport Terminal 2 (X), do not have a letter in their name that is their station headcode. This station is popular for having drivers starting from here to Leighton Stepford Road ( R057 ) as it has more stops than R056 ( Stepford Airport Central <> Leighton Stepford Road ) . This station and Airport Terminal 2 are the first stations to have the "Turnaround mid-route" functionality. There is a path to the ATC tower nearby, but it is inaccessible. Players can jump above the fences by jumping on top of the door and jump again. This will make the player get into the airport.

New entrance 10 December Another sneak peek for Airport West was released, as part of Day 10 of the Advent Calendar. Today's Day 10 sneak peek is another new station, but this one isn't like the others. Airport West is an underground station on Waterline, one stop before James Street. Combined with some lighting updates makes for a nice drive through the tunnels. Coming in V1.1... 🐧 31 December - Version 1.1 Airport West added to the network as part of the Waterline extension , as an underground Waterline through station with 2 side platforms. Now shown in the intro , replacing Stepford Airport Central . New route: R014 2019 17 December - Version 1.4 Airport West is no longer shown in the intro , replaced by Northshore . 2022 12 June Sneak peek for Airport West's overhaul was released. After a bit of quiet while we have been working hard behind the scenes, here is the return of a series of #SneakPeekSundays! 27 August - Version 1.10 Station overhauled, new station building and is now located partially underground. OFF indicators added. Now an out-of-station interchange to Stepford Airport Parkway . Signal Zone moved from Zone F to Zone C . Added Waterline services to Newry Harbour , Airport Terminal 2 and the Esterfield branch . Route change: R014 ( Newry <> James Street → Esterfield ) Now terminates at Esterfield. New routes: R016 , R017 & R018 Trivia [ ] The latest station model resembles the Charing Cross station in Glasgow. [ 1 ] The previous model resembled City Thameslink Station on the Thameslink network in London. This station and Cambridge Street Parkway used to be the only stations on Waterline with a travel time of 2 minutes between them. However, when V1.6 was released, there is also a timing of 2 minutes between Morganstown Docks and Morganstown . The rest only have 1 minute. As of V1.9 , more stations received a travel time of 2 minutes between them, such as Newry Harbour and Newry or between West Benton and Benton . This is the only Airport station not to be served by AirLink . Prior to V1.8 , Leighton City had a similar design to this station, primarily the platform walls. This was the only Waterline station to have had "Stepford" in its name, but "Stepford" was removed with the new human station announcements introduced in V1.8 . Despite this, the official station code from the V1.10 release notes for Airport West is still shown as "SAW". Similar to Airport Terminal 1 , 2 and 3 , which are "SAO", "SAX", and "SAZ" respectively, none of these stations include "Stepford" in their names. Prior to Version 1.10 : Only one route served this station, being R014 (then Newry <> James Street ) . The low ceilings on the platforms caused the top of the doors on some trains to reach above the ceiling. EMUs like the Class 379 and Class 730/0 had their pantographs going through the ceiling. After Leighton City 's upgrade in 1.8 , this was the only station to be fully underground. Despite being a station in the Airport Zone , there were no connections to any of the other airport stations, although one could walk to Airport Central to catch an AirLink train to the Airport Terminals. There was no connecting path between the stations. This station used to lack any OFF indicators despite being a dispatchable station, similar to Berrily . This station was located in signal Zone F as it is a Waterline station. This station had lifts, but ironically was not fully step free as there was a short escalator at the entrance to the ticket hall, which made it wheelchair accessible only for passengers who are inverse changing, and was also the last station on Waterline not having an entrance with wheelchair access. After Version 1.10 : The ceilings were raised with the upgrade of the station. The station was no longer fully underground, as there is an opening above the platforms. The station was moved near Stepford Airport Parkway , now located northwest of Stepford Airport Parkway, making the interchange the second OSI (out of station interchange) in the whole network. This station became a junction. Trains headed to Airport Terminal 2 branch off to the left, where as trains to Farleigh and Esterfield branch off to the right. There is an alphanumeric route indicator located on the signal before the junction, showing "A" for A irport Terminal 2 and "E" for E sterfield . This station was intended to be a terminal station, but the developers decided that the branch line for the station would be too short, so they added another station, James Street . The tracks between this station and James Street were the first lit up tunnels in the whole SCR system. The nearby Airport Terminal tunnels are also lit up. After leaving the station heading to Airport Terminal 2 , there is a Portal Access named " Hempstead Portal Access", a name nowhere mentioned in the game. Melrose Portal Access After leaving the station heading to James Street , there is a Portal Access named " Melrose Portal Access", a name nowhere mentioned in the game. The Waterline tracks between this station and James Street goes under Terminal 2 station. Hempstead Portal Access References [ ] ↑ Stepford Sunday | V1.10 is here! #010 (28 August 2022).

History [ ] 2017 30 December Angel Pass added to the network, located between St Helens Bridge and Bodin , as a Stepford Connect through station with 3 platforms, with Platform 2 & 3 being an island platform for services towards St Helens Bridge . Route changes: R001 , R002 & R003 Now stop here. 2018 6 December Sneak peek for a new passing track at Angel Pass was released, as part of Day 6 of the Advent Calendar. As of V1.1, two of our Connect routes will skip Angel Pass. To allow the network to flow freely for these express services we'll be introducing a passing track at Angel Pass. Here's a pic of it in action for Day 6! 🏂 21 April - Version 1.0 Added Stepford Connect services to the Leighton Zone . New route: R004 Route change: R003 ( Stepford Central <> Winstree → Leighton Stepford Road ) Now stops at Rocket Parade and terminates at Leighton Stepford Road . 31 December - Version 1.1 New passing track added towards Bodin . Added Stepford Connect services to the Stepford Victoria branch . New route: R006 Route removal: R004 No longer stops here. 2019 17 December - Version 1.4 Added Stepford Connect services to Llyn-by-the-Sea . New route: R024 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Now joint managed by Transport for Stepford . Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R033 29 October - Version 1.7 Scenery near Angel Pass was upgraded with a level crossing added between St Helens Bridge and this station. Second entrance added near Platform 3, there is no option to spawn there however. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 No longer a limited-service station. Platform allocation is now randomised at P2-3. Added Stepford Connect services to Upper Staploe . New route: R025 2022 27 February - Version 1.8.2 New route: R045 27 August - Version 1.10 Platform priorities added, allocation is no longer randomised. Bodin P2-3 → AGP P2, then P3 2023 3 March Sneak peek for Angel Pass' upgrade was released. It’s been a while hasn’t it! Well it’s time to get things back on track, so why not have a sneak peek! Coming very soon to an SCR branch near you! 6 March - Version 1.10.4 Station upgraded. Now resembles East Midlands Parkway station . Old second entrance is not demolished but is boarded up, with the new second entrance located to the left of it. There is still no option to spawn at the second entrance. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Angel Pass is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect services are once again limited. New routes: R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 , R136 & R137 Route removals: R024 , R025 , R033 & R045 No longer stop here. Trivia [ ] Since V1.10.4, the station resembles East Midlands Parkway station in Ratcliffe, though Angel Pass does not have a Platform 4 unlike the aforementioned station. This station has step-free access. There is a bypass track in the eastbound direction so that trains which are scheduled to skip this station can pass without being blocked by stopping trains. Similar layouts can be found at Elsemere Junction , Berrily , and Northshore . This is also the only station in the entire network to have a bypass track exclusive to Stepford Connect trains. The viaduct Stepford Express uses can be seen if the camera is zoomed out enough. Before the ex-cancellation of Metro , the viaduct was used by Stepford Connect services. In the past, this station was heavily criticised for being too blocky and old, with many members of the community calling for a complete overhaul of the station. The station was finally rebuilt in V1.10.4. With 1907 days of the station remaining basically the same, only minor upgrades were added overtime. These upgrades being a passing track, upgraded scenery and a new entrance. This station is rarely referred to as "AP" presumably to avoid confusion with A shlan P ark and Stepford A irport P arkway . Stepford Airport Parkway is thus commonly referred to as "SAP", with Angel Pass and Ashlan Park mostly referred to with their full names. When this station was originally released, it was not on the Network Map and onboard announcements were unavailable. This station was once the limited service station with the most number of services calling at it, until V1.8 when its limited service status was removed. With the upgrade in V1.10.4, the original secondary entrance was kept, which is boarded and has two signs that reads " This entrance is now closed, please use the new entrance to your left for access to Angel Pass station. Thank you. " There is also a rusted station sign in the bushes next to it. The second entrance was known for the largest station sign displayed in SCR, until it was removed in V1.10.4. It was very rare to see a train at Platform 3 as this station was typically not busy, however this changed in V1.8 , where trains were randomly allocated a platform, seeing more use of Platform 3. However in V1.10 , eastbound trains now prioritise Platform 2 again, as skipping at a multi-platform through station with random allocation caused SPADs . Signallers could not predict which platform a skipping train would enter, making it difficult to set the signal to proceed before the train reached it. Despite the management transfer to Metro in V2.2 , the station sign at the second entrance is still a Stepford Connect one. There used to be no direct connection to this station from Willowfield . Players would have to change at St Helens Bridge or Beechley instead. In V2.2 , R133 ( Willowfield <> Barton ) was added, connecting the two stations directly.

The more observant / nosey among you will have already seen this, but here is a picture of the stop just before Connolly, Ashlan Park 21 April - Version 1.0 Ashlan Park added to the network as part of the Connolly branch , as a Waterline through station with 2 staggered platforms. Based on Apperley Bridge station . New routes: R011 & R012 2022 25 May - Version 1.9.1 Station overhauled. Now based on Reston station . Removed staggered platforms for side platforms, as well as new scenery including a park. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added OHLE. New route: R019 Trivia [ ] Prior to V1.9.1, Ashlan Park was based on Apperley Bridge station . After an overhaul in the aforementioned update, the station is based on Reston station . Before The Big Update was released, players could trespass to this station and Cambridge Street Parkway . The tracks from Cambridge Street Parkway ended here and they did not continue on to Connolly . There used to be a terminus branch leading from Platform 1 to 2 before its opening. Ashlan Park used to be the only station with staggered platforms across the whole Stepford County Railway network. However, in V1.8 , Woodhead Lane was overhauled and the station's platforms have been made staggered. As of V1.9.1, Ashlan Park have been overhauled without its staggered platforms. Interestingly, the revamped Ashlan Park looks like the pre- V1.8 Woodhead Lane , with a similar platform colour scheme and layout and a brown-ish bridge in the station. Pre- V1.8 Woodhead Lane Before V1.9.1, Ashlan Park heavily lacked scenery and there was nothing except road, bushes and the River Ben near the station, despite being called Ashlan 'Park'. This made Ashlan Park one of the most disliked stations in the game, and the most disliked station on Waterline , tied with the old Cambridge Street Parkway . The overhaul also connected the highway near Cambridge Street Parkway to Ashlan Park. Before the overhaul, it was just weirdly cut off before the tracks to Airport West . Strangely, the 6-lane motorway suddenly turns into a 2-lane level crossing with walking paths just before this station. This station, Beaulieu Park and Hemdon Park are the only stations in SCR to have "Park" in their names. If St Helens Park did open, it would be one of the only stations with "Park" in its name. This station has step-free access. Players can see the Benton Bridge , an ATC tower (probably the one at Stepford Airport) and the towers at Eden Quay if their render distance is high enough. A sneak peek released on the 18th April 2022 saw this station highly speculated to be overhauled in Version 1.9 . After the aforementioned update was released, it was later revealed to be Eden Quay . This station, along with West Benton 's overhaul, was not sneak peeked before V1.9.1's release. This is one of only five stations to have an elevator that serves more than two floors, the others being Stepford Central , Elsemere Junction , Stepford Airport Parkway and Rocket Parade . It is the only station not served by Stepford Connect and the only Waterline station with this trait.

New routes: R049 , R050 , R100 , R101 & R102 Trivia [ ] This station is the second station to have staggered platforms, the other being Woodhead Lane . This station has a rustic-style signal box similar to the Rayleigh Bay Signal Box and the Beaulieu Park Signal Box . However, this building is empty and non-functional. Despite this, it can still be accessed by Signallers . Platform 2 is not step-free due to there only being stair access via footbridge, making it one of the two stations to not be fully step-free along with Eden Quay . This station is one of the five Stepford Connect stations which do not have a route calling at Stepford Central , the others are Leighton West , Millcastle Racecourse , Carnalea Bridge , and Rayleigh Bay .

Metal beams at the construction site spelling out 'M' 'E' 'T' 'R' 'O' 11 May - Version 2.2 Barton added to the network as part of the new Metro operator, as a terminus of the Barton Loop. New routes: R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 & R136 5 August - Version 2.2.1 A poster named "Closing the loop" was added in the station concourse. This won the first Community Spotlight hosted in May 2025. 'Closing the loop' by Sillysausage603 Trivia [ ] This station resembles Liverpool Central . This station is very close to Coxly Newtown at just 0.21 miles. This station is sometimes an overrun spot with trains coming up from Coxly Newtown as it comes up quick and around a corner. This station shares the "B" headcode with Benton . The other pairs of stations that share a headcode are Leighton Stepford Road and Rayleigh Bay , with "R", and Stepford Airport Parkway and Port Benton with "P". It is possible to walk from this station to Coxly & Berrily on road in a few minutes. Currently, station announcements that announce Barton contain an awkward pause before the station name is said. This station is one of the only stations where you don't need to turn around to start a new route, others being Port Benton and Leighton City . Currently the closest spawn point which can let drivers drive toward this station is the Beechley Sidings , which requires drivers to drive for about 15 minutes before arriving Barton. Due to this fact, when Version 2.2 was released, this station had relatively low traffic compared to the Metro Core Section due to traffic heading towards Barton having to pass through there. When Bodin TMD gets added in Version 2.3 , drivers will be able to spawn there and have access to a faster route to get to this station.

History [ ] 2018 13 December Sneak peek for Beaulieu Park was released, as part of Day 13 of the Advent Calendar. I hope you aren't tired of all the new stations yet! Day 13 brings you Beaulieu Park, a new station along the Connect extension ☃️ Second upload for slightly better quality. 31 December - Version 1.1 Beaulieu Park added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 platforms for Stepford Connect and 2 platforms for AirLink . AirLink passes and does not stop here however. Provides out-of-station interchange to the nearby Whitney Green station. New route: R007 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R034 18 October Sneak peek for Beaulieu Park's overhaul was released. Yet another station to get a complete overhaul... Coming soon in SCR 1.7 29 October - Version 1.7 Station overhauled, AirLink and Stepford Express platforms removed. Platforms are now curved slightly, with a footbridge for access both platforms. Scenery near the station was upgraded. Beaulieu Park is now step-free. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Class 720 & Class 730/1 stop markers added to Platform 1 & 2. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Beaulieu Park is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. New routes: R130 & R131 Route removal: R007 No longer stops here. Trivia [ ] There is a station with the same name in Boreham, Essex. A video by video creator Geoff Marshall covering the station's construction site had a large amount of SCR players commenting on it, noting the identical name. This station is an out-of-station interchange between Metro and Waterline , due to the fact that players can walk to Whitney Green from the station. The most convenient way to get to Whitney Green is to follow the path to the park. Players can also walk to East Berrily from this station. Prior to V1.7 , this station was very bare. It contained two strange looking concealed stairwells, 2 bare platforms, some unused platforms on the AirLink tracks for no real reason, and really not much else. The area around it was also incredibly bland, with just some bushes and grass. Before its upgrade, this was one of the only stations in SCR to have neither CIS Boards nor Concourse Information Boards . Until their overhauls in V1.7 , this station looked very similar to East Berrily with its platform layout. However, East Berrily had a foot crossing unlike Beaulieu Park. This station, Ashlan Park and Hemdon Park are the only stations in SCR to have "park" in their name. This station used to be called " Beaulieu Park (Morganstown) ". However, when it opened, its name was shortened to just "Beaulieu Park". Before this station had been upgraded in V1.7 , this station's platforms were slightly shorter than the length of a 5-car train. When a 5-car train approached the station, the announcer would state that the doors of the rear coach would not open. This station's name is sometimes censored in the game chat for no reason. So the community calls Beaulieu Park by its initials: BP. However, "Beau lieu Park" does not get censored. There is a park near the station, however it is closer to Whitney Green than Beaulieu Park. The said park is also the spawn point for the aforementioned station. This station and East Berrily , are the only stations managed by Metro that are not joint managed by Transport for Stepford . The words "beau lieu" in French means "beautiful place", however, it is unknown whether or not the station's name is a coincidence. Notes [ ] ↑ This announcement was used in-game before the introduction of Metro , however, is no longer used.

Proud to connect all of the diverse people and places of Stepford, including some new ones... 👀 22 June - Version 1.6 Beechley added to the network as part of the Willowfield extension , as a Stepford Connect through station and a terminus with 2 island platforms. New routes: R028 , R029 , R030 , R031 , R032 , R033 , R034 , R035 & R036 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Platform allocation is now randomised. Route change: R022 ( Stepford Victoria → Beechley <> Whitefield ) Now terminates here. No longer stops at Stepford Victoria , Financial Quarter , City Hospital , Whitefield Lido & Houghton Rake . 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Beechley is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect . New routes: R103 , R133 & R135 15 October - Sneak peek for Beechley's upgrade was released, based on Cardiff Queen Street station . The sun rising on a nice little revamp Coming to SCR version 2.3 🌇 Trivia [ ] Beechley has not been upgraded since its release. The only change that has been made was the Metro rebranding in V2.2 . This station was previewed on 22 June 2020, and later opened on the same day as part of V1.6 . This was the only station on the Willowfield extension to be previewed to the community before its release. There is a nearby siding called Beechley Sidings . However, it does not lead to the station itself, and instead heads south to Stepford Central and Stepford Victoria . Beechley was City Hospital 's former name, but became its own station in V1.6 as the first stop along the Willowfield extension. The Willowfield extension was unknown to players, up until hours before the release of it. Before The Big Update , Beechley only existed on a map, as there was no station model built for it. The current Beechley is only around 600 metres away from City Hospital . Unused track beds are seen outside of the station. This is similar to many rail lines in the UK after The Beeching Axe in the 1960s. The word 'Beechley' used to be censored by Roblox's filtering, due to it containing the word 'beech', which sounds like a common vulgar word. 'Beachley', however, is fine. This trait is owned by Beaulieu Park , West Benton , Connolly , Coxly and Whitney Green , too. However, many other stations' names can be censored due to lag or chat restrictions. This is the only station along the entire Willowfield Branch to serve all services that use the branch, as some terminate here and do not carry on to Willowfield . This is one of only three stations to serve both routes to Stepford Victoria from the Willowfield branch, the other two being Financial Quarter and Stepford Victoria. Oddly, this station has no ticket machines. On the Stepford Connect map, the Morganstown Connect route shows its availability to go from Beechley to Morganstown. As of Version 2.2 , no Stepford Connect route exists that goes from Beechley to Morganstown nor to Berrily . R034 (now used for Metro ) used to originally be a Stepford Connect route, which follows the Morganstown Connect route lines. The same goes for R030 .

Trains from Port Benton can now use Platform 12, with Platform 13 being no longer exclusive to trains from Port Benton. Trains from Benton TMD can only use Platform 11-13. 24 December - Version 2.1 New route: R088 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Added Metro services. New route: R137 Trivia [ ] The old station resembled the old Birmingham New Street Station , located in Birmingham, UK . After the station's upgrade, the station now resembles the current Birmingham New Street Station . In real life, there is a station with the same name on the Tyne and Wear Metro . This station has step-free access. Benton has the second highest number of platforms out of all stations on the SCR network , at 13. It used to have lettered platforms which gave a total of 16 platforms, which meant it used to have the most platforms. The station with the most platforms is currently Stepford Central , which has 20 platforms. Benton was also the busiest station on the network until V1.1 , with all trains and routes stopping there, even from all depots. This used to be the second hub of Stepford Express (after Stepford Central ) before it was extended via Morganstown . It used to have more Stepford Express trains than Waterline trains because of it. As of V2.1 , 71% of Stepford Express routes stop here, tied with Leighton Stepford Road . [ note 1 ] As of V2.1 , this station serves the most amount of routes out of every other station on the SCR network, at 41 routes. Every Waterline route stops here. Benton only had three platforms when the game was originally released, but due to the number of routes that would run through the station, it was deemed not fit for that purpose, and the tracks were rerouted to a new station. The original entrance to the station no longer exists, and was replaced by the main entrance and the east concourse. The original station was later demolished and replaced. Until V1.7 , each platform entrance had signs for the destinations passengers could go to from each platform. These had not been updated between V1.0 and V1.6 and so were outdated and were later removed with the station overhaul. This is one of the first Waterline stations. Until Stepford Express was opened, in the old Benton, 4 platforms were unused, which gave this station the most unused platforms in all of SCR. All platforms have been in use since V1.4 and after the station's upgrade. A walking route is provided from Benton to West Benton and even further down the line towards Stepford and Newry . There used to be a walking route between here and Port Benton , but after the station upgrade, the road and the pathways were removed for an unknown reason. This station is one of 7 stations on the SCR network which were operated by Network Rail . This station was not wheelchair accessible before being revamped in V1.7 . This is the only station in the game with terminating-only tracks in both directions. The speed limit between here and West Benton used to be 75 MPH, but it was lowered to 45 MPH from West Benton in V1.4.1 and to West Benton in V1.6 . This station received a major renovation in V1.7 . This renovation removed 3 platforms (or added 5 platforms, depending on how the platforms are counted before the renovation) and brought more of a splash of colour and design. The old platforms were numbered 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 5C, 6A, 6B, 7A, 7B, 8A and 8B. Before the aforementioned update, this station had the most amount of lettered platforms in the game, at 15. These platforms were removed and replaced by numerical platforms 1-13. The upgrade also removed the East Concourse entrance, which was the last place players could see the old "rectangle" style ticket barriers. When coming in from the Main Entrance, players will be able to see "the eye" of Birmingham New Street station , the station Benton is based on. They can also see the shopping centre up above. This station is one of five multi-line through stations that are always stopped at by every route that approaches it, with the others being Newry , Stepford Central and Stepford Airport Central . Prior to the station overhaul in V1.7 , players could buy SUFC merch from a stand right outside the station. If a player is driving R039 ( from Leighton City ) and R044 ( from Leighton West ) and attempts to bypass Platforms 6 eastbound, the driver will be despawned with the message "Don't eat the buffers!", despite there not being any buffers at the end of the platform. The track after Platform 2 splits into two, with one track heading to West Benton and the other going into Benton Siding (and from West Benton ). This is likely for the return to depot feature. Strangely, there is an unused through track located between Platform 3 and 4. This track links the end of Platform 3 to the track after Platforms 4-7. This is probably used for freight trains between Airport Parkway and Newry Harbour . A series of electric boxes was added in V1.9 , between Coxly and Benton. However, little players noticed it as it was barely noticeable when driving at full speed. Players can walk from here all way to Stepford without trespassing. If players decide to walk from Stepford to Benton, it would take approximately 18-20 minutes to arrive at their destination. Players can access the roof of this station. This is possible by jumping on commercial buildings located on the second floor. Benton is named after the river Ben . This station shares the headcode "B" with Barton . The only other pairs of stations that share a headcode are Port Benton and Stepford Airport Parkway , which both share the "P" headcode and Leighton Stepford Road and Rayleigh Bay , which both share the "R" headcode. This station has a total of 131 stop marker signs.

New routes: R009 & R044 2022 27 February - Version 1.8.2 New route: R045 27 August - Version 1.10 Added Stepford Connect services to Airport Terminal 2 . New route: R046 2023 2 April - Version 1.10.7 New route: R048 2025 2 November Sneak peek for Benton Bridge's upgrade was released, based on Brent Cross West station . The old infrastructure is water under the bridge around here! 🌉 Coming to SCR version 2.3 Trivia [ ] The frontage of this station is based on Didcot Parkway station . In Version 2.3 , it will be based on Brent Cross West station . This station has step-free access, though there is no lift access. This is because the paths towards the platforms are ramps, not stairs. At the western end of the platform is the River Ben and at the eastern end is the interchange of tracks going to and from Stepford Airport Parkway and Hampton Hargate . Before V1.1 , Benton Bridge was not a dispatchable station. Prior to V1.8 , R009 , and the two Class 68 exclusive routes R026 and R036 were not scheduled to stop at this station. However in V1.8 , R009 was changed to stop here. A lot of people on the Discord server thought this station should be remodeled to decrease traffic. It was remodeled, although is still sometimes a bottleneck, especially heading east towards Stepford Airport Central and Leighton / Llyn . This station used to have the only 2 car stop on Stepford Connect , specifically for the Class 158 /9. Prior to the upgrade, some old signs could be found on the footbridge of this station. The sign for platform 1 said "This platform for trains to to Stepford Central via Coxly " and the sign for platform 2 said "Trains to Stepford Airport and Leighton ". The signs don't mention St Helens Bridge , Stepford Victoria , Edgemead , Westwyvern , Llyn-by-the-Sea , Beechley and Willowfield . These signs and the entire footbridge were removed when the station was completely rebuilt in V1.7 . Prior to V1.7 , this station only had 2 platforms. On the 28th of August 2020, Charlie_RBX sneak peeked an upgraded Benton Bridge saying "Another station with a bit of an upgrade! All coming soon in the next big SCR update". In the sneak peek, there are new commercial buildings, including one named "The Daily Sausage", as a reference to the newspaper in Mind the Gap. On the following day (29 August 2020), a sneak peek of Benton Bridge (the structure) was posted, showing that the bridge has been upgraded into a large suspension bridge, scenery updates around Port Benton , electrification on the Morganstown bridge and several static ships in the surrounding waters. However, some people criticised the new bridge, saying that the gradient of the bridge is too steep for trains and therefore not realistic. Platform 1 allows trains bound for Stepford Airport Central to load without causing traffic for trains towards Hampton Hargate , vice versa. Stepford bound trains can use both Platform 3 and Platform 4 at the same time, although there is only one westbound Stepford Connect track on Benton Bridge (Structure) , so trains have to wait for each other to pass. Though trains from Hampton Hargate cannot go on Platform 4 and trains from Stepford Airport Parkway cannot go on Platform 3. Despite the station lacking electrification, EMU units are still able to serve the station. The same issue also applies to Morganstown Docks .

History [ ] 2018 8 December Sneak peek for Berrily was released, as part of Day 8 of the Advent Calendar. We didn't just extend Connect to Stepford Victoria... we've actually split off at St Helens Bridge for another Connect extension. Say hello to Berrily, part of your expanded Connect network... ⛷ 31 December - Version 1.1 Berrily added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a Stepford Connect through station and terminus with limited AirLink services to Stepford Airport Central only. Resembles Kentish Town station 's Thameslink platforms. New routes: R007 , R008 & R054 2020 15 April - Version 1.4.6 ( Ten Million Update ) New route: R027 22 June - Version 1.6 Platforms and scenery near Berrily was upgraded. Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R030 , R034 29 October - Version 1.7 Station entrance and concourse upgraded. Removed the Metro red. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Lift access added, Berrily is now step-free. 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop marker added to Platform 4. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Berrily is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer terminates here. Added Metro services. New routes: R130 & R131 Trivia [ ] This station bears resemblance to Kentish Town station , specifically the Thameslink platforms. It is also said it resembles West Ealing station . When this station opened, despite being quite a large station, it did not have CIS boards . The same could be said for Morganstown prior to V1.4.1 . There is no platform for AirLink trains going to Stepford Central . To get to this station from the Airport, passengers should take an AirLink service to Morganstown , then change for Stepford Connect or Metro services. It is believed that Berrily has a thriving berry-growing industry, due to its name being a direct nod to the word "berry", and the fact that there is a berry company near the station ( Berry's Berries of Berrily ). The announcements for this station and New Harrow used to glitch and break the station's announcements. This was fixed in V1.3.29. This is AirLink 's least used station as only a single route on their network, R054 , stops at Berrily. Also, due to the absence of a platform for westbound services to Stepford Central , westbound R054 services do not stop at this station. Ironically, the AirLink HQ is located near this station. Walking accessibility is present to Elsemere Junction with the road running alongside the many commercial buildings . This station has two unused tracks alongside with its platforms. This station, although served by Stepford Connect and AirLink , had Metro red colours, as this station was formerly proposed for Metro . This was changed in V1.7 . The same could be said for both Stepford High Street and Whitefield before V1.4.1 . This station, despite being dispatchable, had no OFF indicators. This was also the case with Airport West and Cambridge Street Parkway . This station received a minor scenery update in V1.6 , with the platforms and buildings near the station being renovated. The game's Origin Point (0,0,0) is located here. This was referenced in the 50-million-visit scavenger hunt in V1.10.1 . In V1.7 , the entrance and concourse of Berrily got a revamp, although the platforms themselves remained mostly the same. This station has a footbridge with lifts, although the station was not step-free before V1.8 , because the concourse and the platforms were only connected through a short staircase. This made it step-free for interchange only, similar to Airport West and Stepford Airport Parkway . In V1.8 , a lift was added near the concourse. Since then, this station has full step-free access. There is a depot located near this station. This station could be named after former Product Developer yrrebRBLX, who is named Alex Berry in real life. This station is known in the community for being content creator Dweller 's 'loved' station. He later revealed that his love for the station was purely for satire. As shown in the AirLink operator map , Berrily is shown to be bi-directional unlike Airport Terminal 1 (meaning there are services towards Stepford Central ), though this may just be an oversight. Many players have also hoped to have a westbound platform at this station, though this may never be added as Berrily is unique for only having an eastbound platform for AirLink , otherwise it would just be similar to Elsemere Junction . This is the only station that is owned by Metro that AirLink stops at. Prior to Version 2.2 , it was one of the two Stepford Connect owned stations that are served by AirLink , the other being Water Newton . In 2022, a youtuber called Dweller made a joke about this station saying "Berrily is a pog", because of how many people skipped, or overshoot it. But a youtuber called Trainspotting Mayhem made a diss track called "Trainspotting Mayhem - Berrily Ain't Pog (Berrily diss track)". . The joke has been closed ever since.

New routes: R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 , R136 & R137 Trivia [ ] The station's design resembles a very scaled down Reading station in real life. A gold statue of Thehazad9 is located next to this station. Climbing on top of the statue, grants the badge "Mayor of Bodin". The plaque used to be outdated prior to V1.6 , for it stated that Thehazad9 was the Chief Operations Officer (now called Operations Director ). He was the Community Director (then called People Director ) after this before resigning in October 2019. The old plaque could be found in the bushes near the tracks towards Stepford. This station was next to Bodin TrainCare . Bodin Depot was nearby, but it was demolished in The Big Update . Bodin TrainCare was removed in V1.7 . This was the only station to have more than 2 platforms with no island platforms. According to the sneak peek, the upgraded Bodin has one side platform and one island platform, with passing tracks of Stepford Express between the side platform and island platform. It also has an upgraded footbridge with the word "BODIN" on top of it. This station was one of three stations shown in the Stepford County Railway Intro because of the Class 755 /3 (which is in a special 5 million visits livery) being displayed at Bodin TrainCare , replacing Stepford East in the Five Million Update . It was then replaced by Llyn-by-the-Sea in V1.4 . The other two stations featured in the intro are Rocket Parade (BanTech's HQ) and Airport West (which was replaced by Northshore ). Before Version 1.7 , this was one of only 4 stations with old Banner Repeaters, along with St Helens Bridge , Angel Pass and Morganstown . However, this station was not dispatchable before the aforementioned version. There were once CD/RA indicators here, however, very few people ever got the chance to use them before they were removed. CD/RA dispatching is a proposed feature on the roadmap, so they could be added back soon. This station has become infamous after Charlie_RBX's account was incorrectly terminated on the 24th June 2020, due to a Roblox moderator incorrectly flagging the new announcement for "Bodin" as an inappropriate word, and caused his account to be briefly terminated for a few hours due to an "inappropriate username". In the bushes next to the statue, there was once a rusty sign which used to be on the statue, as Thehazad9 was the People Director (later renamed to Relations Director and Community Director ) before he became Product Developer , which then made the sign incorrect. The sign was changed in V1.6 adding this extra “easter egg”, but as Thehazad9 has since became Relations Director (later renamed to Community Director ) again, the sign became inaccurate. In V1.7 , when the station got upgraded, the sign was again updated, however, he resigned down to PDV again, making the sign once again inaccurate. The sign can now be found laid next to the Stepford City bound tracks before the station. In V1.8 , the train announcements for "Bodin" changed and is slightly different to the V1.7 version. This also happened with Water Newton . The main difference in the current version is that the 'O' is said with more emphasis. In 2020, Bodin was awarded "Capital of Culture" by the fictional committee of the same name. After fraudulently claiming the status was extended to 2022, Bodin was disqualified for the status in 2021 and banned from consideration in 2022. This was explained in an apology from the committee found in advertisements around the SCR Network. Oddly, fewer Metro routes serve this station than Stepford Connect , yet Metro manages this station instead of Stepford Connect as of V2.2 .

History [ ] 2018 21 April - Version 1.0 Cambridge Street Parkway added to the network as part of the Connolly branch , as a Waterline through station with 4 platforms. Based on Cambridge North station . New routes: R011 , R012 & R014 2019 7 August - Version 1.3.21 Cambridge Street Parkway is now dispatchable. 2021 23 October Sneak peek for Cambridge Street Parkway was released. Sneak peeked Cambridge Street Parkway overhaul 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled, platforms decreased from 4 to 3. Now based on M3 Parkway station . Platforms are no longer specific to whether the train heads to Ashlan Park or Airport West . 2022 27 August - Version 1.10 Added Waterline services to Airport Terminal 2 and the Esterfield branch . Route change: R014 ( Newry <> James Street → Esterfield ) Now terminates at Esterfield. New routes: R016 , R017 & R018 2023 31 August - Version 1.10.9 Banner repeater has been added at Platform 3 to improve visibility. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added OHLE. New route: R019 Trivia [ ] Prior to V1.8 , Cambridge Street Parkway was based on Cambridge North station . With its overhaul in V1.8, this station's building now takes the basis of M3 Parkway station in Ireland. This station became slightly busier after the James Street Branch (now Esterfield Branch) was added in Version 1.1 . In V1.10 , its usage has increased again, with three new routes stopping at the station. [ 1 ] Before V1.1 , it was the only Waterline station that had platforms not in use. The station became dispatchable in V1.3.21, although few ever dispatched there due to players rarely driving Waterline . This station and Stepford Airport Parkway are the only parkway stations in SCR. Cambridge Street Parkway and Airport West used to be the only stations on Waterline with a travel time of 2 minutes between them, but when the Morganstown Shuttle was released, Morganstown Docks and Morganstown also have a time of 2 minutes between them. The rest only have <1 minute. Though in V1.9 , timings between Waterline stations have increased due to complaints and the Newry branch upgrade. The station's name on the old driver HUD prior to V1.10 Cambridge Street Parkway has the second longest station name in-game at 24 characters, with the longest being Stepford United Football Club with 29, and the third longest being Leighton Stepford Road with 22. Prior to V2.0 , the name of this station is so long that on the Driver HUD, 'Parkway' is cut off. After V2.0 , the driver HUD now shows the full name of the station. Prior to its removal in V1.8 , there was a sign in the ticket hall says "Frequent services to Benton from Platforms 2 and 4". Ironically, few drivers ever drove Waterline services, and even fewer drove services stopping at this station. From V1.8 to V1.9 , this station had the most parking spaces, at 234. However, Stepford Airport Parkway has beaten this record with its upgrade in V1.10 with a total of 1,013 spaces. Station rebuild posted on 23 October 2021 Prior to V1.8 , many players heavily criticized the station due to the bare colour scheme and lack of scenery nearby, and hoped that there would be an improvement or rebuild of the station in future. Eventually, former Managing Director Charlie_RBX previewed this station rebuilt on the 23rd of October 2021, evident of the station sign. This station was then upgraded in V1.8 . The billboard in the background is a reference to rock band Oasis . After the station's overhaul in V1.8 , access to the platform was replaced with ramps instead of stairs, making this station having step-free access. Prior to V1.8 , this station had two platforms each for eastbound and westbound services (1 & 3 for Eastbound, 2 & 4 for Westbound). Platform 1 and 2 was for services to and from Connolly , and Platform 3 and 4 for services to and from James Street . After the overhaul in V1.8 , Platform 4 was demolished. Platform 3 was converted into a westbound platform, leaving only 1 platform for eastbound services. There are also no longer separate platforms for services to Connolly and services via Airport West . The abandoned structure of Platform 4 and its track beds can still be seen in the station.

We're on one track towards version 2.0 12 August - Version 2.0 Carnalea Bridge added to the network as part of the Rayleigh Bay branch , as a Stepford Connect through station with 1 bi-directional platform. New routes: R049 , R050 , R100 , R101 & R102 Trivia [ ] This station resembles Galashiels station in Scotland. As of Version 2.0 , this station is one of the three single platform stations on the network, the others being Leighton West and Airport Terminal 1 . This station is the only station out of the three to be bi-directional, as well as being the only station to be completely bi-directional on the network. This is the only station on the entire network to not have any signals on or near its platform. Given that there are no signals near this station, the signalling desk cameras barely show the platform. As there are no nearby signals, OFF indicators or banner repeaters, Guards can immediately blow their whistles and close the doors when the train finishes loading, without needing to check the signal aspect. This station is one of the five Stepford Connect stations which do not have a route calling at Stepford Central , the others are Leighton West , Millcastle Racecourse , Aslockby , and Rayleigh Bay .

Trivia [ ] This station has step-free access, however, there is only 1 lift in this station, which is strange considering that there is a hospital nearby. The Willowfield Branch separates from the Stepford Victoria Branch west of this station. There is an actual hospital near this station called Stepford City Hospital (formerly called Stepford General Hospital ) This station was originally going to be called Beechley . The name has since been used by a new station that opened in V1.6 . The "NHS" buildings When seen from above, the buildings near the station spell out the acronym "NHS", which is the National Health Service of the United Kingdom. This was added in 2020, to show support of the National Health Service during the COVID-19 Pandemic. There is a train station with the same name in Northern Ireland. This station was originally a part of the Metro Loop but since the cancellation of Metro , it was instead reopened in V1.1 as a part of the Stepford Victoria Branch . The lights in the concourse of the station are in different colours, those being red, orange, yellow and green in that order.

Feel like y'all deserve an update for your patience! Here is a sneak peEk at the new Connolly station building! (a few more pics to come below, hang tight a sec!) 21 April - Version 1.0 Connolly added to the network as part of the Connolly branch , as a Waterline terminus with 3 platforms with a siding in the middle. New routes: R011 & R012 31 December - Version 1.1 Connolly is now dispatchable. 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Station headcode: C → O C was taken by Beechley . 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Scenery overhauled. Siding now has a not-in-service Class 730/0 . Random platform allocation added. 18 December - Version 1.8.1 Fix : Parked Class 730/0 no longer displays "Welcome on board Stepford Connect " on its PIS . 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added OHLE. New route: R019 Trivia [ ] The station is based off of King's Lynn station in real life. There is a real-life station with the same name in Dublin, Ireland. This station has step-free access. This station was built by AMAviation, a former Control Centre Manager . It was very rare for a train to terminate on Platform 2 or 3 here, because there are rarely two or more trains at Connolly at the same time, since not many drivers drive Waterline . This was changed in V1.8 as platform allocation is changed to be random and trains have an equal chance to enter either 3 platforms. Before The Big Update , the Connolly extension was visible from the refurbished Benton station but services could not run on it. This station is named after Louie Connolly (DauntlessRBLX), a former Manager and contributor to Stepford County Railway . There is a track with no platform surrounding it between the tracks for Platform 1 and 2. After V1.8 , it was occupied by a not-in-service Class 730/0 . Before the station opened, it was supposed to be called Rose Dale Head . This was referenced from an old sign at Newry . Similar to Beechley and Willowfield , its name was later partially reused for Rosedale Village in V1.10 . This is the northernmost point the River Ben can be seen. Just south of this station is a tributary, which is a small stream. Players are able to see Eden Quay from here if their render distance is high enough. Many players like this station due to its good scenery compared to other stations nearby like Ashlan Park and James Street prior to their refurbishments. This station's name is censored in game chat for no reason. In order to get around the restrictions, Connolly has been said in different ways, including: Connoly, Conolly or Conno. This happens to Berrily , Beaulieu Park , Upper Staploe , West Benton and Whitney Green , too. Beechley is also censored, but it has a reason after all. Many other stations' names can be censored due to lag or because of safe chat. This is one of the three stations to have a train stabled directly next to/in the station, the other two being Whitefield and Esterfield . Part of the roof and pillars of the station, as well as the information boards still have the old Waterline colours.

Platform layout remains the same. Platform priorities added, allocation is no longer randomised. Bodin P1 → Coxly P2, then P1 Added Stepford Connect services to Airport Terminal 2 . New route: R046 2023 2 April - Version 1.10.7 New routes: R047 & R048 2024 12 September - Version 2.0.1 OHLE is now meshed. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Coxly is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect . The footbridge has been upgraded. New route: R137 Trivia [ ] The station's platforms resemble a scaled down Denmark Hill station in south London. Before V1.6 , at the top windows which could be seen from trains heading towards Benton , they were once home to the old signalling room , which was left empty before its removal. The one in use currently is the Stepford ROC . Before the refurbishment of Coxly in V1.6 , players could still see its entrance, which was located at the front end of Platform 1 behind the signal. However, no one could enter anymore as it was completely locked up. There were two other entrances to the signalling room in the past, which were located at the station concourse and on Platform 2, but they were removed after its closure. The Old ROC & Coxly Layout. There are two passing tracks between Platforms 2 and 3 which are used by Stepford Express . When Coxly Depot was in operation, drivers from the Stepford City Zone often have their TPWS systems kick in and activate the emergency brakes due to trains from the depot passing in front of them, and the signal system does not give way to trains on the main line first. Formerly, Dispatcher Trainings were held here. Dispatcher trainings have also been held at Stepford United Football Club , Faymere and Willowfield in the past. New players often overshoot this station from both Bodin and Benton as the speed limit on either side of the station is increased to 100 MPH and the players oftentimes do not pay attention to how close their next stop is. SPADs also frequently happen at the eastbound platforms towards Benton as drivers spawning from Coxly Station Siding pass the signal on accident, as it is not located at the end of the platform. Players can walk from here to Stepford and Benton without trespassing. Oddly, fewer Metro routes serve this station than Stepford Connect , yet Metro manages this station instead of Stepford Connect as of V2.2 .

Along with Robinson Way and Upper Staploe (Metro) , this is one of only three stations remaining from the legacy plans. Additionally, Coxly Newtown is the only operational station of the three. The Transport for Stepford headquarters is located opposite to the south entrance of this station. The north entrance is the only remaining evidence of the original Coxly Newtown. Before the modern planning of Metro , the trains were planned to go to Coxly Newtown, then straight into Coxly , where they either terminate or continue onto the mainline. According to the SCR Hub Site , this is the least used station in the game, although this may be due to its recent reopening compared to other older stations in-game.

History [ ] 2018 21 December Sneak peek for East Berrily was released, as part of Day 21 of the Advent Calendar. Coming towards the end of the list of new stations that will be available in V1.1... Day 21 reveals East Berrily station 🌟 31 December - Version 1.1 East Berrily added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 platforms for Stepford Connect and 2 platforms for AirLink , AirLink passes and does not stop here however. New route: R007 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R034 20 September Sneak peek for East Berrily's overhaul was released. Yet another station to receive an overhaul in the next update... Haven't the builders been busy?! Coming soon to an SCR near you 29 October - Version 1.7 Station overhauled, AirLink and Stepford Express platforms removed. Now resembles Ashfield station . Scenery near the station was upgraded. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 East Berrily is now dispatchable. Route removal: R034 ( Beechley <> Morganstown ) No longer stops here. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 East Berrily is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. New routes: R034 , R130 & R131 Route removal: R007 No longer stops here. Trivia [ ] The latest station model resembles Ashfield station in Glasgow. Prior to the overhaul, the level crossing at this station originally despawned people who walked on it. This was fixed, and players can now cross without penalty. In Version 1.7 , the foot crossing was removed and replaced with a foot/road bridge. Until their overhauls in Version 1.7 , this station looked very similar to Beaulieu Park with its platform layout. However, Beaulieu Park did not have a foot crossing then. Players can walk from this station to Beaulieu Park . Players can walk to Berrily Depot from this station, but the road cuts off just before reaching Berrily . There was a commercial building called "Greenslade Security" next to this station. In Version 1.7 it was moved and now sits on top of the tracks beyond the station. In the sneak peek released on 20 September 2020, the AirLink tracks were not present. People at the time speculated that AirLink / Stepford Express services would pass on East Berrily's platforms, or they would run on tracks that were not seen in the sneak peek. It was not known that the slow tracks slightly diverge off the mainline to serve this station. The scenery blocks the fast tracks from view. This also happened with the Upper Staploe sneak peek. Before Version 1.7 , the stretch between Berrily , East Berrily, and Beaulieu Park was very under detailed and lacking in scenery, with just one road and bushes. After the update, the whole Morganstown branch became very detailed, arguably as detailed as the Stepford City Zone . Because this station has short platforms, the rear doors on 5/6 coach trains do not open. This also happens in Hemdon Park , Woodhead Lane , New Harrow and Elsemere Pond . Beaulieu Park used to have this trait. However, its platform is now long enough for some 5 coach trains to fit after the upgrade in Version 1.7 . This station became dispatchable in Version 1.8 . Alongside Beaulieu Park , this station is one of the 2 stations managed by Metro that aren't joint managed by Transport for Stepford . Notes [ ] ↑ This announcement was used in-game before the introduction of Metro , however, is no longer used.

New routes: R010 & Newry Harbour <> Greenslade 2018 14 March Sneak peek for Eden Quay's scenery overhaul was released. SNEAK PEEK I am very pleased to show you the new Eden Quay area! The station had no exit nor scenery so we did something about it! 21 April - Version 1.0 Station scenery overhauled, is now elevated above a river, with the iconic Eden Quay buildings added nearby. Station structure remained the same overall. Added Waterline services to the Connolly branch . New routes: R011 & R012 Route removal: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade Removed from the game. 31 December - Version 1.1 Added Waterline services to the James Street branch . New route: R014 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Announcement change: The Waterline announcement is now: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:EdenQuayW.ogg instead of: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:EdenQuayC.ogg 2022 18 April Sneak peek for Eden Quay's overhaul was released. The first of the next series of sneak peeks coming to you in the near future. Something feels different, but what could it be? Coming Soon 15 May - Version 1.9 Station overhauled, is no longer above water but is still near a river. Scenery upgrades around the station, with the iconic Eden Quay buildings moved further away from the station however. Added limited Stepford Express services to Newry and Leighton City . New route: R086 27 August - Version 1.10 Added Waterline services to Airport Terminal 2 and the Esterfield branch . Route change: R014 ( Newry <> James Street → Esterfield ) Now terminates at Esterfield. New routes: R017 & R018 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 1 & 2. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 New route: R120 Trivia [ ] The newest station model is based on Dockyard station in Devonport, Plymouth, England. Prior to The Big Update , there was no water beneath the station, and no buildings surrounding it. It was on the grass surrounded by bushes, with no exit and no scenery. Before Version 1.9 : This was one of the few stations in the game that did not have a road near their entrance. The other stations with this trait are Stepford Airport Central , Airport Terminal 1 , Airport Terminal 2 , and Airport Terminal 3 . This was the only overground station on the entire SCR network that did not have a direct, ground-level entrance. Airport Terminal 1 also has this trait, however it is situated underground. This was the only station to be completely above water (even the entrances). This was the only station to have a tilted station sign. This was the only elevated station on Waterline . The station was not dispatchable. This was the only station in SCR that was built on a quay/river. Financial Quarter does not count because it is only above a river and not built on a river. In other words, it is not entirely on water If the player goes around the harbour, they will come across a foot crossing. This station has step-free access, but for Platform 2 only, as there is a short staircase at the entrance to Platform 1. Hence, passengers requiring step-free access will have to take a northbound train to Newry for inverse changing if they wish to travel southbound from this station. As of V1.9 , this is the only Stepford Express station which is not fully step-free. As of V2.0 , this station and Aslockby are the only stations which are not fully step-free. Members of the SCR Community often call this station in a parodical name - "Eden Quack". Eden Quay is somewhat an "icon" station for Waterline , due to the number of Waterline adverts featuring this station and the scenic view of the lights on the buildings, especially at night. There is an underpass to the south of the station entrances, which you can walk under. This station can be difficult for Dispatchers as the only way to switch platforms is by exiting the station, walking across a bridge, and then re-entering the station. This may cause slight delays for trains. This is the only Stepford Express station where the short platform announcement can be heard on the Class 221 and Class 800 , which only the front 4 coaches fit into the station. There is a quay with the same name in Ireland.

What a refreshing feel this sunrise brings 12 August - Version 2.0 Station overhauled, now based on Newark Northgate station . Platform 1 now also serves terminating services, with Platform 2 serving through services. Added Stepford Connect & Stepford Express services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New routes: R049 , R050 , R100 , R101 , R102 & R087 Bugfix : Trains can now terminate from the Leighton City/West direction again. 24 December - Version 2.1 New route: R088 Trivia [ ] The station is based on Newark Northgate station in Nottinghamshire, England. Previously, it was based on Fareham station in Hampshire, England. This station, along with Rayleigh Bay and Westercoast , are the only stations served by Stepford Express that are managed by Stepford Connect . Some longer-standing members of the community affectionately call the barn outside of Edgemead, towards Leighton City "Mugmead" after former SSG Muggenzifter . The station name Edgemead is a compound word of "edge" and "mead" (meaning a meadow), likely referring to its location away from Leighton and how it is located in a more countrysided area. However, due to "mead" also meaning a type of alcohol, the name is sometimes censored in the in-game chat, leading to players calling the station joke names like "Edgemeat" or "Eggmeat". This station, along with Leighton Stepford Road , Leighton City , and Leighton West , are 4 consecutive terminating stations with no through stations in between. The old Platform 1 used to be rarely used after V1.4 as most players drove beyond Edgemead towards Llyn-by-the-Sea , and it could only be used by R004 and R009 which terminate at Edgemead. This is one of the two stations where trains from both directions can terminate at the same platform, the other being Leighton City . This station is the third station to use the turnaround mid-route functionality, after Airport Terminal 2 and 3 . At the north of Edgemead, a rusty post for the banner repeaters of signal S383 and S385 can be seen which held the banner repeaters for the signals before Platform 1 and 2.

History [ ] 2018 17 December Sneak peek for Elsemere Junction was released, as part of Day 17 of the Advent Calendar. I'm running out of ways to introduce a new station, but for Day 17, have another one... 🥂 31 December - Version 1.1 Elsemere Junction added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a Stepford Connect through station with 4 platforms with a passing track for AirLink trains. New routes: R007 , R008 & R053 2019 1 February - Version 1.1.9 Added AirLink services to Airport Terminal 1 & 2 . Route change: R053 ( Stepford Central <> Stepford Airport Central → Airport Terminal 2 (via T1 ) (S) ) Now stops at Airport Terminal 1 & 2. 2020 15 April - Version 1.4.6 ( Ten Million Update ) New route: R027 22 June - Version 1.6 Station signage changed to have no operator. Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R034 29 October - Version 1.7 Elsemere Junction is now managed by AirLink and Transport for Stepford . Added limited Stepford Express services to Stepford Central / Westwyvern . New route: R082 2021 26 September Sneak peek for Elsemere Junction's overhaul was released. And the next station overhaul… Coming soon to v1.8! 5 December - Version 1.8 Station overhauled, new station building and platforms are more detailed. Now resembles Worcestershire Parkway station . Elsemere Junction is now dispatchable. 2022 27 August - Version 1.10 New route: R059 2023 17 July - Version 1.10.8 Class 80x stop markers added to Platform 3 & 4. 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Platform 3 & 4 extended to accomodate for longer trains. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Added Metro services. New routes: R130 , R131 , R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 & R136 Trivia [ ] The current version of this station resembles Worcestershire Parkway station . This station only has one passing track instead of two for both directions. The same goes for Angel Pass and Northshore . This may cause SPADs to occur when an AirLink or Stepford Express train is loading at Platform 3 and there is a train that skips this station behind it, as the speed limit is increased to 125 MPH before this station. Numerous commercial buildings make up some of the scenery near this station, including the famous PizzabyBilly. Currently, this is the only AirLink station joint managed with Transport for Stepford . This is currently the only station that is managed by AirLink but not located in the area of the former Airport Zone . This is also currently the only station served by Stepford Express and Metro that is managed by AirLink . Despite being an AirLink station, only two routes ( R053 and R059 ) service at the station, meaning it is considered a limited station on the AirLink map. Like Leighton Stepford Road , this station used to owned by Connect before V1.6 Currently, only one Stepford Express service ( R082 ) stops here. This station and Eden Quay are the only Stepford Express served stations that do not receive direct services to Llyn-by-the-Sea . Prior to V1.8 , even though Stepford Express serves this station, it was not available on their operator spawn options. If players wanted to spawn as a Passenger or a Guard at this station, they needed to use the AirLink or Stepford Connect list. This issue has now been fixed. This station has walking access to Berrily via a road placed on the side of several commercial buildings . This station and Elsemere Pond are the second closest stations on the network, with a distance of 0.26 miles between each other. The line between Port Benton and Morganstown Docks beats this by 0.09 miles with a distance of 0.17 miles apart. As a result, announcements do not say the stations the train will be calling at between these two stations because of the short distance. This station is one of the 6 triple-line junctions alongside Stepford Central , St Helens Bridge , Benton , Airport Terminal 2 and Leighton Stepford Road . This is the only station on the Morganstown branch that was not overhauled in V1.7 . When the sneak peek for the overhaul in V1.8 was released, some have incorrectly speculated that the passing track will be removed for AirLink / Stepford Express trains to Stepford Central , as it is not seen in the image and appears to be facing Stepford City . This is because the sneak peek was facing the concourse which was on the west side at that time. However, this remained unconfirmed as the image is facing the direction towards Morganstown , not Stepford Central , with evidence of Signal A025 and the platform number. Ultimately, the passing track remained in V1.8 and the concourse has been moved to the eastern side of the station. Before V1.8 , this station was not dispatchable despite having OFF indicators. Elsemere Junction is unique for featuring platform deck detailing; this can also be seen at Financial Quarter . When the station announcer announces services for R082 ( Stepford Central <> Westwyvern via Morganstown ), the train announcer still says " Stepford Express , service to: Westwyvern , via, Morganstown ." even though Elsemere Junction is already on the Morganstown Branch . Until V2.2 with the opening of the Barton Loop , this station wasn't actually a junction despite having had the name "Junction" in it.

History [ ] 2018 20 December Sneak peek for Elsemere Pond was released, as part of Day 20 of the Advent Calendar. Day 20 brings you Elsemere Pond 🎆 31 December - Version 1.1 Elsemere Pond added to the network as part of the Morganstown branch , as a limited-service Stepford Connect through station with 2 platforms. New route: R008 2020 15 April - Version 1.4.6 ( Ten Million Update ) New route: R027 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New route: R030 29 October - Version 1.7 Station and scenery overhauled, with a footbridge added. 2023 6 March - Version 1.10.4 Elsemere Pond is now part of the training map. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Elsemere Pond is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. Station overhauled, resembles Ainsdale station . New routes: R034 , R130 , R131 , R132 , R133 , R134 , R135 & R136 Trivia [ ] Currently, this station resembles Ainsdale station . This station has step-free access. The eastbound platform is accessible via a ramp at the entrance and the westbound platform can be accessed either via the footbridge or foot crossing. Passengers needing step-free access to the westbound platform should use the foot/road crossing. All Metro services call at this station, with Stepford Connect no longer stopping at the station. In V1.7 , the station's position on the map changed. This station gets its name from the pond nearby and the area where it is located. This station was one of the few stations in the game where players can only cross platforms by crossings. A footbridge has been added in V1.7 . Until V1.1.3, the foot crossing was broken as kill blocks were left in. It is possible to walk from here to New Harrow and Angel Pass without trespassing. It is possible to walk to St Helens Bridge via a road running alongside the railway tracks. This station and Elsemere Junction are the second closest stations on the network, with a distance of 0.26 miles apart. However, the line between Port Benton and Morganstown Docks beats this by just 0.09 miles with a distance of 0.17 miles between each other. The foot/road crossing here is a popular place to stand and get flung by passing AirLink and Stepford Express services which often pass through at speed when not slowing to stop at Elsemere Junction . The station is immediately after the viaduct for Stepford Express services via Morganstown and merge onto the AirLink tracks. No Stepford Express or AirLink services stop here though as no platforms exist. In the training map introduced in Version 1.10.4, Elsemere Pond is one of two through stations. Elsemere Pond did not recieve direct services to Morganstown until the addition of Metro in V2.2 . Notes [ ] ↑ This announcement was used in-game before the introduction of Metro , however, is no longer used.

Bringing you the worst, best kept secret in the whole of Stepford county... 27 August - Version 1.10 Esterfield added to the network as part of the Waterline extension , as a 4 platform Waterline terminus. Based on Clacton-on-Sea station . Platform 4 is a split platform with Platform 4A and 4B, Platform 4A is unused however. New routes: R014 & R016 Trivia [ ] Esterfield is heavily based on Clacton-on-Sea station in Essex. This station is one of the two stations to have split platforms, the other being Morganstown . However, Platform 4A is not used, and has a Class 143 parked in it. Benton shared this trait before V1.7 ; Newry also shared this trait before V1.9 . This station was highly anticipated by the community, as the name was leaked over a year before its official opening, evident of leaked audio files containing the name that were found as early as 2021. The name of this station was inspired by an older project by BanTech , under his old account Jelly134. His first popular game, Esterfield Bus Simulator (EBS) was a UK based bus simulator that existed around 2012. While this game is no longer available to play, permission from BanTech has been acquired to re-publish some version of the game on the catalog. The shunt signal at platform 4B does not stop trains from passing it. This makes players approaching Platform 4B able to pass the shunt signal and crash into the Class 143 parked at platform 4A. If a player attempts to hit the Class 143 however, they will get despawned with the "Don't eat the buffers!" message although there are no buffers after Platform 4B. Sometimes a driver can crash into the parked Class 143 if the driver is laggy and enters the platform at full speed. This station, along with Airport Terminal 2 [ note 1 ] , has the most platforms served by Waterline trains than any other station, with four. This station also has the most platforms out of any station owned by Waterline , with five. Esterfield (Q), as well as Farleigh (J), Leighton West (K), Airport Terminal 2 (X) and Airport Terminal 3 (Z), do not have a letter in their name that is their station headcode . The station has a parked E200 MMC outside the main station entrance, however the bus is for scenery only. Just outside the station, there is a playground with a roundabout, a swingset, a slide, and tables. However, the slide and the roundabout has no collisions. There is a church next to the playground with a cemetery. Gallery [ ] Sneak peek of Esterfield, published by Community Director tjh44 on 24 July 2022 A Class 143 parked at Platform 4A A Class 143 terminating at Platform 4B Esterfield station at night Station sign as seen in game Notes [ ] ↑ Airport Terminal 2 mainly serves AirLink trains. However, due to platform allocations being randomised, Waterline trains can terminate on any platform. Hence, Waterline trains can use all four platforms at the station.

New routes: R011 & R012 Route removal: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade Removed from the game. 1 December Sneak peek for Faraday Road's overhaul was released, as part of Day 1 of the Advent Calendar. Day 1... 🎅 your first sneak peek of version 1.1: 31 December - Version 1.1 Station overhauled. Platforms increased from 2 to 3. Platform 3 leads to nowhere however. Added Waterline services to the James Street branch . New route: R014 2019 13 June - Version 1.3.13 Platform 3 is now in use, for ECS trains from Faraday Road Depot towards Newry . 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Faraday Road is now dispatchable. Announcement change: The Waterline announcement is now: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:FaradayRoadW.ogg instead of: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:FRC.ogg 2022 15 May - Version 1.9 Scenery near Faraday Road was upgraded. Track and platform layout remains unchanged. Stepford Express services can now pass this station. 27 August - Version 1.10 Added Waterline services to Airport Terminal 2 and the Esterfield branch . Route change: R014 ( Newry <> James Street → Esterfield ) Now terminates at Esterfield. New routes: R017 & R018 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 New route: R120 12 September - Version 2.0.1 Platform 3 can now serve as a bypass/overflow to Platform 2. ECS trains from Faraday Road TMD can still only use Platform 3. Trivia [ ] Faraday Road loosely resembles Stetchford station . This station has step-free access. This station's renovation was the first item on the V1.1 Advent Calendar. In V1.1 , this station received a major upgrade as voted for by hundreds on the SCR Discord server. It is possible to hear traffic from the mainline a half mile down. Prior to V2.0.1, Platform 3 used to be only for ECS trains coming out of Faraday Road TMD . Unlike Platform 1 at Coxly , where there is a similar station layout, there was no crossover track for mainline trains to enter Platform 3. Prior to V1.0 , Eden Quay was designed to similar specifications to this station. The Class 730/0 in the sidings used to say "Welcome on board Stepford Connect " despite belonging to Waterline . This was patched in V1.10 . The Waterline Headquarters is located right next to this station. The depot shown in the Driver menu when picking a train is actually floating above near this station. In order to see it, players would need a high render distance and graphics and looked above Faraday Road Depot . However, this was fixed in a later update where the depot would turn invisible for players not in the menu. Stepford Express trains do not stop at this station, including R086 that is able to spawn at Faraday Road TMD .

"Taking you to the Far parts of the county on todays episode of #SneakPeekSundays! Coming soon to an SCR version 1.10 near you! " 27 August - Version 1.10 Farleigh added to the network as part of the Waterline extension , as a Waterline through station. Platform 1 is also used as for terminating services from Newry Harbour . Based on Surrey Quays station . New routes: R014 , R016 & R018 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Missing announcements on Stepford Connect and Stepford Express have been added. Trivia [ ] This station is based on Surrey Quays station in London. Farleigh provides a connection to the nearby 'University of Benton', as seen underneath the station's signage. This made many people in the community think that this station would be located in the Benton area . The station turned out to be the first station past James Street . Even though the university is named after Benton, the location of it is very far east from Benton. It takes about 6 minutes from Benton to this station without delays. Some people speculated this station to be a terminus, since the unoccupied platform shown in this station's sneak peek also had a green signal and stop car markers. However it could have also meant the platforms are bidirectional or that there are more than one platform in that direction. It was revealed in V1.10 that Platform 1 is both a through and terminating platform, while Platform 2 is a through-only platform. This station took over the "J" headcode from James Street . Farleigh (J), as well as Esterfield (Q), Leighton West (K), Airport Terminal 2 (X) and Airport Terminal 3 (Z), do not have a letter in their name that is their station headcode . There is a road from this station leading to Airport Terminal 2 . There is another road connecting Upper Staploe to this station. If one walked from this station to there, it would be faster than taking a train. This also applies to walking from Rosedale Village to Water Newton which the starting point is in the same Zone G. When driving to Benton on a Stepford Connect or a Stepford Express train, the announcer on-board does not state that the player can change trains to get to Farleigh. In place of these announcements is dead air and the logs show that these files are missing, likely due to developer oversight. This issue has been fixed in Version 2.0 . Originally, this station was to replace James Street and James Street itself would be completely demolished [ 1 ] . Some players have complained about Platform 1 being the terminating platform instead of Platform 2, as trains terminating at Platform 1 causes delays for trains headed to Esterfield . Additionally, due to the timetable giving a whole minute from James Street to Farleigh despite both stations being very close to each other, trains behind would have to wait up to two minutes for the terminating train to unload passengers and turn around. There is a commercial building named "Far from leigh(ton)" near the station. As of Version 2.0 , only diesel trains are allowed to terminate here as the only route terminating here is R018 , where the starting point, Newry Harbour , is unelectrified.

A small village situated one stop away from Edgemead. This station will be served by Connect but is a cool place to watch Express trains pass at speed! 🏘 17 December - Version 1.4 Faymere added to the network as part of the Llyn-by-the-Sea extension, as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms with 2 bypass tracks between.

New route: R042 2023 6 March - Version 1.10.4 Dispatcher and Guard trainings are no longer held at Faymere and now in a seperate training map. 2024 8 July Sneak peek for Faymere's overhaul was released. Zooming along the up fast towards version 2.0! 12 August - Version 2.0 Station upgraded, station entrance is now on the ground with a station car park. A footbridge now connects the 2 platforms, with the platforms now coloured red. Track layout remains unchanged. Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New routes: R050 & R102 Trivia [ ] The Class 68 and Class 444 exclusive routes, R026 and R036 , as well as Stepford Express , skip this station via the bypass tracks that cross the middle of the station. Trains on R004 , R009 and R041 spawning at Faymere Green NB Depot will also use the bypass tracks to skip this station while deadheading to Edgemead . Before V1.5 , this station was not dispatchable, despite having OFF indicators. There are no services to Stepford Victoria at this station as they all go on the passing tracks, passengers should change at Edgemead or Stepford Central to go there. Oddly, this station has no ticket machines.

New routes: R136 & R137 Route removals: R045 & R046 No longer stops here. Trivia [ ] The station resembles South Quay station in real life. This station has step-free access. However, lift access is only available at the west entrance. This station was originally going to be named Willowfield before it was revealed. The name Willowfield was reused for the Willowfield extension in V1.6 . The new Willowfield station was comparatively far from this station compared to City Hospital and Beechley . (City Hospital was originally going to be called "Beechley") The CIS Boards at this station do not function properly yet for an unknown reason. This is the only station to be located above/on a body of water. Prior to V1.9 , Eden Quay also shared this trait, until its overhaul. This station is unique for its elaborate platform surface detailing. This can also be seen at Elsemere Junction . This station was originally a part of the Metro Loop but since the cancellation of Metro , it was instead reopened in V1.1 as a part of the Stepford Victoria Branch . The station's Metro branding has been criticized by players as being ill-suited, compared to the Stepford Connect branding used prior to Version 2.2 , especially the escalators going up to platform level.

'Redefining travel' from eseopuhasnewname Trivia [ ] Before its name was revealed, many players speculated that the station sneak peeked on 17 March 2025 and the construction site near the Stepford Connect Headquarters were the same station. Where the station had the name "_r W_". However, even before the sneak peek on 17 March, the name "Four Ways" had already been leaked. Due to the similarities and the four way junction nearby, many players believed that the construction site was Four Ways station. This station is one of the two stations to not have a sign with its name in the entire network , alongside Stepford High Street . This station has received criticism from many players for being a bottleneck between Stepford Central and Stepford East , as both of these stations have 4 Metro platforms while this station only has 2. However, this may simply be due to the popularity of Metro following its introduction in Version 2.2 , and this likely exceeds the intended capacity of the station.

History [ ] 2017 16 December Greenslade added to the network, as a Waterline terminus with 2 side platforms; and a Tramlink through station. New route: R013 21 December New routes: R010 & Newry Harbour <> Greenslade 2018 21 April - Version 1.0 Route removal: Newry Harbour <> Greenslade Removed from the game. 2020 22 February - Version 1.4.1 Scenery near Greenslade was upgraded. Added OHLE for both Waterline and Tramlink . 2021 1 January - Version 1.7.1 Station overhauled, new station building and platforms for both Waterline and Tramlink , as well as scenery upgrades. Waterline platforms now form a single island platform. 5 December - Version 1.8 Greenslade is now dispatchable. 2023 6 March - Version 1.10.4 Greenslade is now part of the training map. Trivia [ ] The concourse is based off of Oxford station . The platforms may be based on Bromley North station in London. There is a train station in South-East London called ' Slade Green ', the opposite of Greenslade. Prior to The Big Update , this station had services to Newry Harbour . Now, passengers will have to change at Morganstown Docks for the nearest direct service to Newry Harbour. This was one of the first Waterline stations. This station was most likely named after someone with the Roblox username SirGreenslade, who was a Security Officer for SCR. A Security Officer is a former High Rank . SirGreenslade is now a QD within SCR. When Greenslade was electrified in V1.4.1 , the Tramlink tracks got electrification as well, making part of the community anticipating that Tramlink might be fully implemented in the future. However, former Product Developer Mattyx2013 later stated that the Tramlink tracks got the OHLE only because it would look bland if only the Waterline ones got the overhead line equipment. The scenery between here and Whitney Green was also updated in the aforementioned update. Before V1.7 , if players walked on the Tramlink tracks, they could have found 2 abandoned stations at the west of this station, namely Berrily Denton Road and West Berrily , and the tracks ended just after West Berrily. These 2 stations were demolished in V1.7. After the aforementioned update, the Tramlink tracks now run into an inaccessible tunnel right after passing this station. This station has a ramp to platform level. Because the station's name used to be censored in in-game chat, it is often referred to as 'Green Salad' by players, usually in a humorous vein. It is quite common to see Waterline trains here as R013 ( Benton <> Greenslade ) is a popular points and experience grinding route. In the training map introduced in Version 1.10.4, Greenslade is at both ends of the five training corridors. It is also the station showcased in the training map main menu. However, the training version of this map lacks a second set of points allowing trains from either platform to turnaround and return as Trainee Drivers are asked to leave the server upon completion of the route. Greenslade in the signalling map (V1.7.1-V2.1.5) Despite the upgrade giving it an island platform in V1.7.1 , the station was still displayed with side platforms on the signalling map. This was eventually fixed in V2.2.0 .

History [ ] 2017 29 November Hampton Hargate was added to the network, as a major through station with 8 platforms, to serve Metro , Stepford Connect , Stepford Express and High Speed. New route: R003 2018 21 April - Version 1.0 Station overhauled, platforms reduced from 8 to 2. Now serves Stepford Connect only, with passing tracks on the side. Added Stepford Connect services to the Leighton Zone . Route change: R003 ( Stepford Town <> Winstree → Leighton City ) Now stops at Rocket Parade and Leighton Stepford Road and terminates at Leighton City. New route: R004 31 December - Version 1.1 Added Stepford Connect services to Stepford Victoria and Edgemead . Route change: R004 ( St Helens Bridge <> Leighton City → Edgemead ) Now terminates at Edgemead. New route: R009 2019 17 December - Version 1.4 Added Stepford Connect services to the Llyn-by-the-Sea branch. New routes: R024 , R025 & R026 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Added Stepford Connect services to the Willowfield branch . New routes: R035 & R036 29 October - Version 1.7 Station overhauled, now has 2 side platforms for Stepford Connect and 2 side platforms for Stepford Express and AirLink . Both pass and do not stop here however. Added Stepford Connect services to Upper Staploe . New route: R039 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Added Stepford Connect services to Leighton West . Route change: R039 ( Benton <> Leighton Stepford Road → Leighton City ) Now terminates at Leighton City. New route: R044 2022 27 February - Version 1.8.2 New route: R045 Trivia [ ] This station was originally going to be a major interchange incorporating eight platforms serving Metro , Stepford Connect , Stepford Express and High Speed, but all except two platforms were removed completely, and now it is a small and quiet station. This might be because Benton and Morganstown are not far from this station, and having three major stations very close together would be unnecessary. This station is one of the stations that received a scenery upgrade in V1.7 . Before the scenery upgrade, there were buildings located next to the station. However, this was seen as a downgrade instead by players as the area around the station now lacks scenery with the update removing buildings near the station. This station is one of the stations that many players consider to have the worst scenery in SCR, as the roads here do not connect anywhere and are just cut off, and this station also does not have any foliage or buildings nearby. The only thing there is a car park. After the V1.7 upgrade, platforms were added for the AirLink / Stepford Express passing tracks. However, they are not in use and no platform numbers are given to them. Among them, the eastbound passing platform forms an island platform with Platform 2. However, the eastbound passing side is fenced off as passengers are not supposed to enter. The westbound passing platform is inaccessible as the station footbridge is not connected to it, it also lacks any proper entrance. Although Morganstown can be seen from here with a high enough render distance, there is no direct link between them, so passengers have to go either via Benton or Leighton Stepford Road to get there. It is speculated that this will not be the case in Version 2.3 due to Stepford Connect getting routes to Westwyvern via Morganstown There is a siding east of this station, which is Hampton Hargate Siding , but trains cannot go to this station from there. There is also a track at Platform 1 that branches into the siding, likely for the future " Return to depot " feature. Despite not stopping here, Metro has an announcement for this station. The same applies to Leighton Stepford Road .

History [ ] 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Hemdon Park added to the network as part of the Willowfield extension , as a Stepford Connect through station with 2 side platforms. New routes: R028 , R030 & R031 2024 24 December - Version 2.1 Station overhauled, with new scenery and full step-free access to the station. Platform layout remains the same. Now based on Ashley Down station . 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 Hemdon Park is now managed by Metro instead of Stepford Connect ; Stepford Connect no longer serves this station. New route: R133 Trivia [ ] The station is based on Ashley Down station . Prior to V2.1 , the station was based on Reading Green Park station . Prior to Version 2.1 , Hemdon Park was not fully step-free due to the lack of lifts to access Platform 2. It was one of three stations in the game that were not fully step-free, with the others being Eden Quay and Aslockby . This station, along with Willowfield , was not previewed before V1.6 . This station does not serve many routes unlike Willowfield and Beechley . Despite this, it is not considered a limited service station. This is the only station along the Willowfield Branch to have a name that was not used in the past, as both Willowfield and Beechley were planned to be served by Metro then. The old Willowfield is now Financial Quarter and the old Beechley is now City Hospital . After Version 2.2 , all Stepford Connect routes ( R032 , R035 & R036 ) now skip this station. This station's platforms are slightly shorter than the length of most 5-car trains. When they approach the station, the announcer will state that the doors of the rear coach will not open. This also happens at Woodhead Lane , New Harrow , Elsemere Pond and East Berrily . This station, Ashlan Park , and Beaulieu Park are the only stations in SCR to have "Park" in their name. This station is the Beechley Royal Upholstery House, a commercial building along the Willowfield line. Despite the name, the Beechley Royal Upholstery House is not at Beechley . Humorously, its name abbreviates to "BRUH." The name "Hemdon Park" may be a reference to "Hampden Park," a football stadium in Glasgow, UK. Glasgow also has a football club called Rangers F.C.. Just north of this station, there is a line of trees and a bridge over nothing with a right of way for a rail line that leads to a stop with grass platforms and no name. Innovations Director BanTech stated that this line is meant to be similar to an old and abandoned railway, similar to the unused track beds at Beechley . This could also be a reference to the Beeching Axe . There is a road that leads to Stepford UFC station from here, albeit not directly as the road floats above the actual road of said station. Notes [ ] ↑ This announcement was used in-game before the introduction of Metro , however, is no longer used.

New routes: R020 & R022 2020 1 May - Version 1.5 National Rail logo outside the station was replaced. 2021 5 December - Version 1.8 Now a limited-service station. Scenary near Houghton Rake was upgraded. Station remains unchanged overall. Added OHLE equipment. Route change: R022 ( Stepford Victoria → Beechley <> Whitefield ) No longer stops here. 2023 6 March - Version 1.10.4 Houghton Rake is now part of the training map. 2025 11 May - Version 2.2 OHLE removed. New route: R103 Trivia [ ] This station mainly resembles Eastham Rake , aside from the passenger bridge and the tunnel at the eastbound end of the station. Ironically, considering both stations end with ‘Rake’. Along with Woodhead Lane and Westercoast , the level crossing is not functional and will stay lowered even if there is no trains. There is a small path next to the level crossing to cross platforms. Although it has not been confirmed, players speculate that this station was named after "Haughton Foundry", the group that created the game "Mind the Gap". This group was created by yrrebRBLX , one of the ex- PDVs at SCR who modernised Stepford Central . This station was one of few across the network to have a red National Rail logo outside the main entrance of the station. This was replaced when Stepford Connect was rebranded. As of V1.8 , this station is classified as a limited-service station. In the training map introduced in V1.10.4, Houghton Rake is one of the two through stations with Elsemere Pond .

History [ ] 2018 5 December Sneak peek for James Street was released, as part of Day 5 of the Advent Calendar. I sense a theme going on here... Promise we've done more than just stations and routes 😂 here's Day 5: James Street on Waterline extension ❄️ 31 December - Version 1.1 James Street added to the network as part of the Waterline extension , as a Waterline temporary terminus in a trench with 2 side platforms, only Platform 1 is used. New route: R014 2020 22 June - Version 1.6 Buffer added at the end of Platform 1 to prevent trains entering the tunnel and getting despawned. 2022 31 July Sneak peek for James Street's overhaul was released. Bet you weren't expecting this many station sneak peeks, but yet here we are, for another instalment of #SneakPeekSundays! 27 August - Version 1.10 Station overhauled, now located fully underground with an island platform. Now a limited-service Waterline through station. Station headcode removed, as James Street is no longer a terminus. J was taken by Farleigh . Signal Zone moved from Zone F to Zone G . Added Waterline services to Newry Harbour and Farleigh to Esterfield . Route removal: R014 No longer stops here. New routes: R016 & R018 Station models [ ] Original terminal station [ ] Prior to Version 1.10 , the station was the terminus of a branch from Cambridge Street Parkway , infamous for its outdatedness. It was also the site of a long-awaited extension with the tracks continuing past the station into tunnels. Before the addition of a buffer at the end of platform 1 in V1.6 , if a Driver attempted to go beyond the station or overshot the platform their train would be deleted immediately with a message saying "Invalid track detected". The station was also humorously viewed as cursed or creepy by some people, since it was left virtually untouched from its release unlike many other stations on the network. This was also due to the fact that the surrounding area lacked any form of scenery whatsoever, and that the area was quite remote from other parts of the county. The station was also placed in a trench. The station also only saw one service stopping, that service being R014 . This led to the train frequency being very low, as only few drivers chose to drive said route. Refurbishment [ ] James Street was refurbished in V1.10, which involved replacing the old station model in the old trench with a new underground station, adding a non-usable siding beyond the station towards Farleigh, and building a ticket office and new stairs and lifts down to the platform level from the surface. The station was also fitted with CIS Boards . The station entrance now resembles Farringdon station 's Barbican entrance, while the station itself resembles London Paddington's Elizabeth line station , which can be seen from the lights' designs above the platform. [ 1 ] The services serving the station were changed to be two new routes, R016 and R018 , with the original service, R014 , being changed to now skip James Street. This also made it the first and only Waterline route to skip any stations. Trivia [ ] Easter Egg Before V1.6 , the Waterline platform signs at Benton did not mention this station. In Liverpool, England, there is a station with the same name on Merseyrail's Wirral Line. Next to the station entrance, in an alleyway between a white building and a brown wall, there is a text saying " GREEISM WAZ HERE! " with 2 green paint products lying on the floor. These paint products seem to be manufactured by " Gree's Paint Factory ", as it says on the left capsule. Greeism was one of the Platform Managers , who helped with the surrounding scenery for the update. In V1.10 , James Street is no longer a terminal station, therefore its headcode "J" was moved to Farleigh . There is a siding near this station with a not-in-service Class 730/0 parked in it, though no trains can spawn there as it is occupied and too short for another train. Players thought that this siding would be a new spawning point for trains due to a sneak peek showing James Street inside of the Class 730, however this was not the case, and the siding is purely decorative. This was evident before Version 1.10 was even released due to the fact that in the sneak peek, signal D183 is shown as red, even though there is no other train inside James Street. Although the network map shows James Street as a limited-service station, the Waterline operator map shows James Street as a regular-service station on the Esterfield Branch . According to Product Developer tpx_jm, this is to show clearly that there are services that skips James Street on the network map . Though because 2 of the 3 routes stop at this station (and not less than 50% of routes), this station is not shown as limited in the Waterline operator map. This station was supposed to be demolished and replaced by Farleigh , according to Mattyx2013 . This would've made it the second station to ever be demolished, the other being Winstree [ 2 ] . This did not happen for unknown reasons and Farleigh is now the next stop eastwards on the Esterfield Branch . Excluding Metro stations, this is one of two fully underground railway stations, the other being Airport Terminal 1. In V1.10 , Airport Terminal 2 was rebuilt above ground, while James Street was rebuilt below ground. Prior to V1.10 , if the player's render distance was high enough, they could see a purple building with an ATC tower west of the station, which was the building of Airport Terminal 2 . After V1.10, players can directly walk from and to Airport Terminal 2 via road which is about 0.21 miles away. The tunnel section between this station and Airport West is located right under Airport Terminal 2 . According to Mattyx2013 , he designed a station model intended for Whitefield Lido at first, but then the model was changed to be used at James Street instead. [ 2 ] However, the model was never used, with many users speculating the current look of the Airport area being the reason for that. Between 1.6 and 1.9.7 the lights at the entrance to the station were painted in the old Waterline colours. The aforementioned Sneak Peek , showing the station without any buildings The original sneak peek of this station for 1.1 showed it without the surrounding buildings. Before V1.10, on the other side of the tunnels, the tracks would turn red (apparently to remind BanTech to replace them) and split into four tracks, before going to an unnamed station.

However it was designed for through services, which finally was extended in Version 1.1 , when the station was used for services to and from Edgemead . Despite being called "Leighton City", it was not at all connected to Leighton Stepford Road nor Rocket Parade via road, and the only thing that would make one think is that it was actually in a city is that the platforms were underground. Version 1.4.1 [ ] As part of Version 1.4 , Express was released with R077 stopping here. In addition, this station was also supposed to be redesigned in this update, but it did not fit in it. Hence the redesigned station was instead released in Version 1.4.1 . Version 1.8 [ ] Leighton City was overhauled with an increase to 6 platforms and became the main station of Leighton, as well as now being above ground. All Stepford Connect and Stepford Express services that terminated at Leighton Stepford Road now terminate here instead, as well as all services that skipped Leighton City no longer doing so. However, AirLink services still terminate at Leighton Stepford Road.

Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New route: R101 12 September - Version 2.0.1 Platform 3 & 4 can now serve through services if Platform 1-2 & 5-6 are full. 24 December - Version 2.1 New route: R088 Trivia [ ] This station is based on East Croydon . Prior to V1.8 , this station was based on City Thameslink . Prior to V1.4.1 , this station was based on Charing Cross (Glasgow) . Coincidentally, Airport West was previously based on City Thameslink and is now based on Charing Cross (Glasgow) . This station was originally going to be called "Leighton", which can be seen from the station signs prior to The Big Update . Although "city" is in its name, Leighton City didn't look like a city before V1.4.1 , as the only scenery was a street with a building. Before V1.1 was released on New Year's Eve of 2018, this station served as a terminus for trains from St Helens Bridge on R004 The sign located at the end of the platforms until V1.1 Before Version 1.1 , if any train proceeded past the sign that read " LINE CLOSED - DO NOT PROCEED " at the end of the platform, the train would be despawned automatically and the player would have been ejected. The same currently applies to the Platforms 3 and 4 at this station and other stations with platforms that have no buffers for terminating having the same trait. It also used to happen at James Street , but a temporary buffer had been installed there until the James Street Extension was released in V1.10 . Leighton Stepford Road used to have this trait as well before its Stepford Connect and Stepford Express terminus function was replaced by this station. Prior to V1.8 , this station was one of very few stations in the game to be underground, along with Airport West , Airport Terminal 1 and Airport Terminal 2 ; this was also the only non-airport and Stepford Connect underground station in the whole SCR network . When this station was a terminus before V1.1 , it was planned to serve Stepford Central -bound trains, but the idea was turned down, and trains terminated from St Helens Bridge instead. This changed in V1.8 , as the station is now the principal station in the Leighton Zone . Before V1.1 , it was not possible to dispatch at this station, and Platform 2 was unused. Platform 1 was used as a temporary terminating platform, which is similar to James Street before the extension opened in V1.10 . If one tried to make the old TTS voice on-board announcements for this station, they will have to use "Laighton City" instead of Leighton City to get the voice similar to the one in game. This is because when "Leighton City" is used, the voice says "Lee-ton". This is the same with Leighton Stepford Road . This station got its first upgrade in V1.4.1 . The terminating junction was also removed, meaning it was no longer possible to terminate at this station. After the second overhaul to the third generation in V1.8 , trains are able to terminate here again. This station was considered to be one of the worst-looking stations before its first upgrade. An advertisement for West Benton Pet Supplies was once placed on the Stepford Connect Information Board. However, it was removed in V1.8 , along with the one at Whitefield Lido . The ad can still be seen at Whitefield and Starryloch . The platform walls of the second generation station were similar to the ones at Airport West . Managing Director Charlie_RBX previewed this station again on 3 October 2021, with the station being handed over to Transport for Stepford and the number of platforms being tripled to six. Some people thought that the upgrade would be Westwyvern . Some people had once thought that due to the size of the station, Leighton Stepford Road might be closed and replaced with this station. However, another sneak peek released later on 14 November 2021 debunked such theories. Many players are confused as to why Leighton City was revamped as they claimed that the overhaul has no legacy to its second generation upgrade, and that the station was perfectly fine at its previous state. After the V1.8 revamp, all Stepford Connect and Stepford Express services that used to terminate at Leighton Stepford Road now terminate here instead. In addition, all Stepford Express services that passes through this station now stop here. Before that, R077 was the only route that stopped here. However, two AirLink routes, R056 ( Leighton Stepford Road <> Stepford Airport Central ) and R057 ( Leighton Stepford Road <> Airport Terminal 3 ), still terminate at Leighton Stepford Road instead of terminating at Leighton City despite the latter station being the new main station in the Leighton area . After the V1.8 update, this is one of the two stations where trains from both directions can terminate at the same platform, the other one being Edgemead . Previously, Leighton Stepford Road also had this trait before most terminating services were moved to Leighton City. Despite the station being handed over to Transport for Stepford , dispatchers working at this station were still given the Stepford Connect dispatcher uniform , instead of the generic SCR version used on stations managed by Transport for Stepford . This is possibly because Leighton City used to be owned by Stepford Connect before its upgrade in V1.8 , and it was simply an oversight from the developers. This was fixed in V1.9 . Despite being a major station, there are no ticket machines available for passengers anywhere in this station. This station, along with Leighton Stepford Road , Leighton West and Edgemead , are four terminating stations that are next to each other without any through stations in between. From V1.8 to V2.0 , this was one of the five multi-line through stations that were always stopped at by every route that approached it, with the others being Stepford Central , Benton , Newry and Stepford Airport Central . However, this became untrue with the arrival of R100 , where trains exiting Leighton Depot skip this station to go directly to Edgemead . Only three Stepford Express routes do not stop here, with those being R075 , R079 , and R087 . This means that this station could be considered as the operator's transport hub. In V1.8 , this station became notorious for its frequent signal failures (Signals S355 and S357), which is caused by the system thinking another train is still inside the block when it has already left. This caused the signals to stay locked at red occasionally and cannot be manually changed by a Signaller . Because of this, if a signal failure was detected in a server, Supervisors ended up shutting them down to prevent disruption. According to then- Community Manager tjh44, the root cause of the bug was not really known by the developers at the time, and the problem was clearly not a quick and easy fix. In V1.9 , this bug was patched. The light version of the Network Map in V1.8 showed that no Stepford Connect services stopped at Leighton City (and Edgemead ) despite it stopping at both, this was possibly due to an oversight while adding Leighton West to the map. This was fixed in V1.8.4. This happened again with the V2.0 map, where Leighton City had completely disappeared from the dark version of the Stepford Connect map. This was later fixed. R100 ( Leighton West <> Rayleigh Bay ) skips this station if spawned at Leighton Depot to Edgemead , being the only route able to skip Leighton City. There is a parked Class 68 near this station.

Poles on the platform have been recoloured from Stepford Express pink to black. 24 December - Version 2.1 New route: R088 Trivia [ ] This station is based on Haymarket station in Edinburgh, Scotland. Before V1.8 : This station resembled Manchester Oxford Road station in Manchester, England . On some occasions, when Platform 1 was already occupied by an AirLink or Stepford Express train, trains could terminate on Platform 2, and if both Platforms 1 and 2 were occupied, trains could terminate on Platform 3. This happened very rarely though. This station was once the only through station in the game in which trains could terminate on every platform and from both directions, with platforms having Stop Markers at both ends. With the trait now replaced by Leighton City and Edgemead . This station was an overground station. Every route that approached this station stopped here, but since Leighton City became the major station at Leighton after that version, this is not the case anymore. Although the 5 car variant of the Class 43 is able to go on R076 when it terminated here, due to the length of Platform 1, the driver needed to stop very close to the buffer or else they could not open the doors and complete the route. Players could walk to Rocket Parade , but not Leighton City Like Elsemere Junction , this station used to owned by Connect before V1.6. After V1.8: Players can now walk from here to Leighton City . However, they can no longer walk to Rocket Parade . All Stepford Connect and Stepford Express services terminating here previously now terminate at Leighton City instead. R056 ( Stepford Airport Central <> Leighton Stepford Road ) and R057 ( Airport Terminal 3 <> Leighton Stepford Road ) still terminate here as of V1.8 , instead of terminating at Leighton City despite the latter station being the new main station in the Leighton area . During V1.6 and V1.7 , when some eastbound Stepford Connect services still terminated here, they did not use Platform 1. This was to allow trains from Stepford Central or Benton to terminate and continue onto R037 and R038 to Llyn-by-the-Sea and Westwyvern respectively. Before V1.6 , R003 could terminate on Platform 1, since the latter routes did not exist. This station has the third longest name in the game with 22 characters, just 2 characters fewer than Cambridge Street Parkway in second. But the longest name is Stepford United Football Club with 29. In V1.6 , new signs without operator branding were added at this station, just displaying the station name. The same could be seen at Elsemere Junction . Both of these signs were replaced with Stepford Express signage and AirLink signage respectively in V1.7 . The destination on the trains used to display "Leighton Stepford Road" in The Big Update , then it was changed to just "Stepford Road" in V1.1 due to some trains not being able to fit the destination properly on the destination board, but in the Five Million Update , it was changed again to "Leighton Step Rd". This was the first station ever to have through and terminating platforms shared by more than one operator. In the Five Million Update , AirLink was extended to this station to celebrate the game reaching 5 million visits. Currently, this station is one of the 6 triple-line junctions alongside Stepford Central , St Helens Bridge , Benton , Elsemere Junction , and Airport Terminal 2 . However, unlike most triple-line and quad-line junctions, this station is not run by Network Rail or Transport for Stepford , being run by Stepford Express instead. This also applies to Elsemere Junction and Airport Terminal 2 , which are stations operated by AirLink . Platform 1 used to have an old buffer , but it was replaced in V1.6 . This is the same as Stepford Airport Parkway Siding . This station once had the National Rail Double Arrow symbol for the entrance signage prior to V1.8 . Before V1.7 , although this station served AirLink , it was not on the spawn list for AirLink , so passengers spawning here had to spawn from the Stepford Connect or Stepford Express spawn lists. This was fixed in the aforementioned update. Although the station is called "Leighton Stepford Road", the decals outside the station entrance before V1.8 displayed "Stepford Road". Moreover, it was then possible to walk under the station. In V1.8 , R081 ( Stepford Central <> Llyn-by-the-Sea (super fast) ) was changed to stop at Leighton City instead of this station, making it the only Stepford Express route that is able to skip this station. This makes R081 the only route (that does not come from Leighton Depot as an ECS) to be able to skip this station. A Class 755 which passed through the buffer After the station's overhaul in V1.8 , the buffer at the end of Platform 1 did not despawn trains even if the driver crashed into it, allowing trains to crash and even go through the wall behind it. However, the train would still be despawned by other messages instead of the usual "Buffers don't like to be eaten." . This was fixed in V1.8.4. This station, along with Leighton City , Leighton West , and Edgemead , are four terminating stations that are next to each other without any through stations in between. Between V1.6 and V1.7, neither any SCR operator , Transport for Stepford , nor Network Rail managed the station. The station was unbranded and very simple signage. This also applied to Elsemere Junction . In V1.10 , trains now enter Platform 2 first as random platform allocation at through stations that allow skipping caused SPADs as Signallers do not know what platform the train is entering, therefore unable to set the signal to proceed before the train reaches the platform; and trains from Leighton City now prioritise Leighton Stepford Road Platform 4 if they come Platform 3 & 4, and Platform 5 if they come from Platform 5 & 6, this is to allow two trains to enter Leighton Stepford Road smoothly without a train unexpectedly entering another platform and crossing the junction, causing a SPAD . The black stripes on the pillars at the station were pink prior to V2.0 , many people said that this makes the station look worse than before. This station shares the headcode "R" with Rayleigh Bay . The other headcode sharing pairs of stations are Port Benton and Stepford Airport Parkway (P), and Benton and Barton (B). Despite not stopping here, Metro has an announcement for this station. The same applies to Hampton Hargate .

It serves Stepford Connect services to Benton , Leighton City , Rayleigh Bay , Edgemead and Llyn-by-the-Sea . After a double-track triangle from Leighton City and Edgemead , the line is merged into a single track. The majority of the line is a single track except for a passing loop, allowing two trains to pass, expanding capacity on the line.

The vote gained a total of 7,349 votes as of 5 December 2021 with 2,906 votes for the Stepford Connect extension and 5647 votes for the Waterline extension . Extension preview and clarification [ ] The sneak peek, revealed by Charlie_RBX on 22 August 2021 On 22 August 2021, a sneak peek of a Class 333 departing to Llyn-by-the-Sea from an unknown Stepford Connect station was released, which led to some people in the community believing this sneak peek could represent a new station, and that it seemed like the extension was built in favour of Stepford Connect , despite more votes for Waterline . However, others thought that it might also be possible that the developers had decided to do both extensions, though this was unconfirmed at that time. Many people have also said that the station resembles Colchester Town . Later, during the Developer Q&A on 23 October 2021, Charlie_RBX has officially announced that both extensions will be built, in which the Stepford Connect one will be included as part of Version 1.8 . The Waterline Extension , however, would be built in another future update as part of the huge overhaul for the Airport Zone . Version 1.10 eventually saw the release of the Waterline Extension .

Apologies it has been a while everyone... Expect quite a lot in this channel over the coming weeks! 👀 We have been working hard on so so much behind the scenes as we work towards v1.8. It is still a little way off but, in the meantime, we will do our best to keep you adequately sneak-peeked! Coming soon to an SCR near you 5 December - Version 1.8 Leighton West added to the network as part of the Leighton extension, as a small 1 platform Stepford Connect terminus. Based on Colchester Town station . New routes: R041 , R042 , R043 & R044 18 December - Version 1.8.1 Announcement change: The Platform announcement is now: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:LWPNew.ogg instead of: https://scr.fandom.com/wiki/File:LWP.ogg 2024 12 August - Version 2.0 Added Stepford Connect services to the Rayleigh Bay branch . New route: R100 Trivia [ ] This station is based on Colchester Town station in Essex. This is possibly an homage to the nearby former Winstree station, which was based on Colchester station. Although this station has the word "Leighton" in it, this station does not have any road connections to the Leighton Zone . If using R041 and R043 , the driver is able to drive from Leighton City to Edgemead via this station and select routes that are available to those two stations. Upon the release of V1.8 , heavy congestion at this station was common due to the fact that many drivers flooded here to visit this new station. Most of the branch line to this station is a single line and has a low speed limit of 30 MPH, worsening congestion. Signals in the area were also affected by a bug that locks them to danger, making all traffic to and from this station come to a standstill if it occurs. This has since been fixed. This station, despite having 5 routes terminating here, only has limited train service as two of the routes ( R041 and R043 ) only serve the nearby Edgemead and Leighton City stations respectively, and are the shortest services in SCR. In addition, the size of it and the mostly one-track layout on the line leading to it makes this station look tiny with low passenger demand. This station is one of the five Stepford Connect stations which do not have a route calling at Stepford Central , the others are Millcastle Racecourse , Aslockby , Carnalea Bridge , and Rayleigh Bay . This is also the only station in Zone D that does not have a route calling at any stations in the Stepford Area. This station is one of the three stations to have one platform, along with Airport Terminal 1 and Carnalea Bridge . When the initial sneak peek for this station was released, many members of the community believed that the station would be named Westwyvern West, Hemdon West , or similar, based off the vaguely visible CIS Board in the background. This station, along with Leighton Stepford Road , Leighton City , and Edgemead , are 4 terminating stations that are next to each other without any through stations in between. Leighton West (K), as well as Farleigh (J), Esterfield (Q), Airport Terminal 2 (X) and Airport Terminal 3 (Z), do not have a letter in their name that is their station headcode . Prior to V2.0 , this was the one of the two stations with a speed limit of 15 MPH on the station approach, with the other being Newry at Platform 1. The disused platform, with an overgrown trackbed There is a disused platform next to Platform 1 with an empty and overgrown trackbed. Narratively, this suggests Leighton West was originally a 2-platform station, with Platform 2 disused likely due to low passenger demand. However, it is also likely that the disused platform is also taken from the station Leighton West is modelled after ( Colchester Town station ). This is the only station whose platform announcement was redone.
