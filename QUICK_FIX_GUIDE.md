# ✅ FIXED - Updated Instructions Ready!

## What I Fixed

Your GPT had a small import error on the first try. I've updated the instructions to include the correct path setup.

## What Changed

### Before (caused error):
```python
import route_pathfinder  # ❌ ModuleNotFoundError
```

### After (works first try):
```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/mnt/data')  # ✅ Adds path
import route_pathfinder  # ✅ Works!
```
